#### _Disclaimer:_

You don't really need to read this. I'm making this .doc as a means of preserving important data about 4chan, its culture and its history in case the original sources go down (and they did). Think of this as a time vault for the long future (as long as my hard drive doesn't die and somebody downloads this). For some, reading this will feel like a chore.

Most content is based from (AKA Copy pasted, mixed and made sense of) content already written by various sources. All content post 2012 is from personal, firsthand experience and second hand accounts.

This .doc contains:

A summary of 4chan's history, adapted and updated from an existing summary on GitHub's Bibanon Wiki, which was then used to update GitHub's summary as a gesture of thanks.

A small description of the users that composed 4chan and /b/ over the years, assembled in generations. Mind that this is based on archived thread and screenshots, it should not be taken as complete truth, as the margin of error may be too big.

A modified (mixed and revamped) 4chan timeline originally from Lurkmore wiki that was hanging around different sites for years, in many different versions. It includes information on 2chan and the forerunners of the imageboards and textboards.

A timeline about the known dates of all board additions.

A list all of known staff members, their activities and shenanigans. You shouldn't take this information as facts, as information about the staff is always filled with false rumours. Approach with lots of caution.

A list of sources and useful links, dead legacy links and resources.

If you have any information that you know is wrong or does not appear on this .doc please point it out or if I don't respond put it in yourself, just make sure that it mixes with the rest of the article, has a proper source (or you where there when it happened), and that it's clear it's a newer version.

This .doc is built with impartiality and objectivity in mind, while some partiality is inevitable, the main purpose of the .doc is to be an objective summary and timeline of all things 4chan.

Unfortunately, the most focused on board is /b/. It doesn't mean there isn't an interest in the other boards, as the document is meant to be as extensive as possible, but while modern day /b/ is not what it was, it still has the greatest amount of recorded history, saved images and screenshots, enough to write this summary. The rest of the boards, save some exceptions, lack such information, so most of their history them will be rather modern. Nowadays, it's impossible for one man to record the events of all the boards.

This .doc should not be attributed to anyone, as it's made by anonymous, for anonymous.

Thanks for reading. - Anonymous

## Genesis, Part One

_(1995 –2003)_

4chan was the result of the collusion of two cultures - The Western Internet discovering the Japanese imageboard BBSs and the culture that came with it. The netizens of both sides have their own particular characteristics but a common origin: Internet culture as we know it originated when people began to switch from USENET to BBSs. The Japanese side of the story is rather large, as it was composed of tight-knit communities of Geeks that already had their own meta jokes by 1996, while the western side (that was a direct influence to 4chan) possesses a relatively static culture that can be dated as far back as 2000.

On Japan, Internet culture began to form out of people who used Home Parties
# 1
 circa 1995. The "underground" Internet, the first sites to leave USENET, was composed by technology and hacking
# 2
 enthusiasts and pedophiles. What would become textboard culture and ultimately engulf the entirety of Japanese Internet culture began with one man: Masayuki Shiba.

Shiba started a Home Party on 1995 called Ayashii World (Ayashii Warudo - あやしいワールド), via provider Nifty-Serve. The site was dedicated to a controversial underground game called Kasumigaseki, based on the Tokyo Subway attacks. While it was an unrelated, short-lived site, the name stayed with him. In 1996, Shiba comes in contact with a site called Japan Lolita Complex Graphics (日本ロリコングラフィックス), dedicated to child pornography and ran by Duke Pedo (ペド侯爵 - Pedo Koushaku). JLCG used a variety of free Internet hosting services and an anonymous BBS. This greatly influences Shiba, and he recreates Ayashii World as one of the first BBSs on the Japanese Internet, operating with anonymous posting and free web services (In this particular case, Mails by Postone, Hosting by Tripod, registration free; anonymous BBS code by Digital Eden. Yes, anonymous culture was literally born out of some Jap's desire to post CP). The original topics of Ayashii World were mainly Lolicon, CP
# 3
 and Geek culture discussion like cracking and SJIS art. The main appeal of the sites would be anonymous discourse – The possibility of not being identified led to a raw, no-holds-barred discussion between the Nanashiis
# 4
 people would come to the board to distance themselves from the heavily manners-oriented Japanese society.

Ayashii World would proceed to become an important center of the Internet. Further into 1996, one of the first Underground sites, dedicated exclusively to technology and hacking, A Portal to an Underground (地下道入口, Chikadou Iriguchi), closed. The majority of its userbase would flock towards Ayashii. Its users introduced warez and MP3 files to the general net and the contributed greatly to making Ayashii become a household name in the Japanese underground, with many "sister" sites adopting the Ayashii World system. The web of similar sites having "AyashiiWorld#" as a prefix would collectively be called the Nameless World (Nanashii Warudo). Common traits among Nanashii World sites would be that the admins would begin their name with "Kanrinin-san" (Mr. Admin)", The users would come to be fond of absurd humour and visual memes such as the Giko-Hanyann or Giko-Neko (Giko-Cat), a small SJIS cat with a speech bubble that says "Itte Yoshi", which depending on the typing system may mean "Please Leave" or "Please Die". The speech bubble itself also enabled them to express short sentences. Ayashii would change BBS host from Digital Eden to Kenjinkai, which only let them write one line, and after Kenjinkai drops them, their own code. Important things would happen in Ayashii, such as hackers posting about their important hacks and later getting arrested or the leaking of the name of the Sakakibara killer, which would throw the Ayashii World sites into disarray and get many BBSs to crash or temporarily go offline.

In Ayashii conflict between the old and new userbase began to arise and Shiba decides to divide the BBS in two, one called 97, for general topics, and another called 2000, for technology. 2000 would soon become the gesu (Scum) board, because of their habit of planning and participating in forum invasions, raids and hacking, including popular sites from RL companies. Their attitude would go on through the years, in a reminiscent way of the raid culture 4channers pertained during the days of 2006 and 2007. The split did not quell the conflict, however, and in late 1996 the users of 2000 would eventually create their own site, called Guess BBS. 2000 would be the birth Japan's legendary cracking group, GUESS.

On 1997, the first imageboard, Licentious Notice Board, is created by Mr. Fujinami. Its userbase exceeds at image collages and comedy and the site becomes a fad on the Japanese Internet. However LNB is short lived and no new imageboards are created due to a split between its userbase. LNB's personality and methods of posting made it in many ways a forgotten precursor of 2chan.

The end of Ayashii comes from the hands of Mr. Alice, Guess BBS's administrator. On March 1998 he codes an auto-posting script and uses it to spam Ayashii. Enraged, the userbase of Ayashii retaliates and hacks Guess. Despite Shiba's attempts at stopping them, later during April they leak Alice's dox and manipulate images of him. Scared due to the possibility of a lawsuit, something that's very costly on 90s Japan, Shiba shuts Ayashii World down. The Ayashii World is left without its core for some weeks, until it's rebuilt by Shiba as Ayashii World Main BBS (あやしいわーるどメイン掲示板). Some months later, he abruptly closes the BBSs, tired of the site's hostility and incapability to deal with new users. This time, the whole collective of sites is thrown into complete disarray. Many users flock towards the Ayashii World sister site @an unofficial shelter purpose (@退避用非公認), declared the new main BBS. However, some weeks after Shiba left, Amezo BBS, a small part of the Nanashii World founded by Mr. Amezou on 1997, implements the floating thread system, dependent on aging (posting to bump a thread to the top of the list) and saging (posting but not bumping the thread). In contrast to tree pile-up style, where users would see most the recent replies to threads on the front page and reply to those replies, which made threads hard to follow, the floating thread system was easy to manage and understand. Amezo BBS quickly rises through the ranks, eventually becoming one of the biggest of the Ayashii World.

Ayashii World was not dead yet. Shiba creates Magmania, one of the first Japanese personal review sites. However Mr. Alice is still furious at Shiba and pressures him into apologizing via BBS and phone. Eventually he succumbs to pressure and requests the Ayashii World sites to stop suing the prefix. Shiba, humiliated, quits the Internet for good. Most sites reluctantly comply and those who don't are raided into submission. By 1999, very few Ayashii sites remains, the biggest among them Honten, which is hacked by Alice himself. However Honten users break off and found AyashiiWorld#REBIRTH. REBIRTH endures several DDoS and invasions, but eventually manages to surpass Honten in terms of userbase thanks to an ad campaign and an anime logo. Said logos attracts a considerable population of Otakus, which were previously looked down upon by Shiba and the Ayashii Worlders. REBIRTH's admin turned out to be a tyrant and many Ayashii Worlders moved to AyashiiWorld@familie. By this time, ASCII/SJIS art was greatly influenced by @unemployed (@無職), whose "Ayashii taste" ASCII edits, that took a much simpler approach, deforming images in comic forms, became the main way to create ASCII in the Ayashii World (The other way, which eventually ended up in 2chan, was more serious and tried to translate images to ASCII instead of deforming them). This would be all the contributions the collective would give to 2ch's culture.

The same year, Hiroyuki Nishimura, copying Amezo, creates 2 channel (2ちゃんねる – Ni Channeru - The Second Channel, in honour to Amezo being the first), abbreviated as 2ch. 2ch's population would retain many cultural trends of Ayashii World, but it would gradually see an increase of Otakus in their userbase. Otakus were still mainly shunned in Japan, and Shiba and his users were not an exception. An animosity between both userbases begins to rise. Amezo eventually dies due to vandalism, and it's later revealed that Hiroyuki was heavily involved in spamming Amezo. Mr. Amezo tries to compete with 2ch by founding 1ch.tv, but strict posting standards and the later introduction of a fee for posting made the site unpopular. 2ch would create a peculiar board, /news4vip/ - News for VIP. An equivalent to /b/, VIPPERs would form a very distinct culture, fond of absurdity and SJIS art. Hiroyuki would have a second that usually patrolled /vip/, Nakao Yoshihiro (handle name 'Night Shift ★' and 'FOX ★'). His personality itself would eventually grow to become a meme within 2ch.

2ch would come to antagonize Ayashii World in many ways. Trolling, spamming, claiming Ayashii memes as their own and using Ayashii services without permission. Animosity would explode into hate when a thread popped up in Ayashii REMIX detailing all the attacks. Ayashii Worlders would script spam 2ch until it crashed. Hiroyuki personally apologizes to them in the thread, and later at the main site Ayashii World II. However trolling between both sites would keep on for years, a common insult from Ayashii Worlders to Nichanners would be "Tantsubo' (痰壷).

With the years, 2ch would go on to become a massive cultural phenomenon in Japan, achieving mainstream appeal. The possibility of unfiltered discourse fit perfectly with the Japanese cultural tendency of the in and out personalities – a Japanese person must never show his opinions and beliefs in public, which should only be expressed in the house or with one's most trusted friends. 2channel would also become quite influential: Things like the movie Densha Otoko was based on the real story of a 2ch NEET who found himself on the good side of a girl but didn't know what to do, so he asked for help on 2ch and the users of the site helped him win her.

By 2001, 2ch began to fall apart as data transformation bugs threatened to render the entire website unusable. Users began to warn of the coming apocalypse while volunteers from across Japan worked to find a solution. On August, its users make a backup BBS: 2chan (Futaba Channel - ふたば (双葉) ☆ちゃんねる - Futaba Channeru). 2chan, however, wasn't just a clone site. It implemented a handcrafted imageboard code called Futaba. For a while, 2chan would serve as the alternative hub for nichanners whenever 2ch crashed, but eventually it formed its own distinct culture and drifted apart. 2chan was not the first imageboard, however imageboards were a pretty rare thing, and many similarities can be drawn between older imageboards and 2chan. 2chan and 2ch would come to greatly surpass the Ayashii Collective in terms of sheer population, 2ch would become a national phenomenon, with over 10 million users per month and several hundred boards, even influencing the RL with tales like that of the Densha Otoko, which eventually got made into a movie. While 2ch diversified, 2chan remained Otaku-centered.

The western side of the story is shorter. While we can trace back Internet culture to MUD BBSs back in the 80s, those directly responsible for what would become 4chan came to be on 1999, with Lowtax founding Something Awful. Under the slogan of "The Internet makes you stupid." Something Awful, as the name suggests, was a site dedicated to parodying and writing about all the bad and ugly things the post-bubble internet had to show. Lowtax and friends would make comedic posts around particular themes in the front page and had a personal forum for discussion of various topics. Sometimes they would organize contests, mainly Photoshop centered. Lowtax later charged an entry fee of 10 dollars – 10 bux, as it's colloquially known. Despite the blatantly elitist move, sites like SA were few and far between, and its ranks filled quickly. SA formed a culture around elitism, e-peen size and a reputation for trolling and drama (As much as they hate to admit it), gathering a skilled userbase of Photoshop wizards, coders, musicians and excessively ban happy mods, becoming a major source of Internet culture and popularizing lasting influences such as the image macro, the demotivational poster, Numa Numa, and All Your Base are Belong to Us.

Peers and contemporaries with legendary trolls such as Gamefaqs' LUE forums and the GNAA, whenever someone badmouthed the site one could expect an horde of goons to descend upon it, usually spamming it and tricking the site's users into clicking the Last Measure, a weaponized website that locked the user's browser and spammed the phrase "HEY EVERYONE, I'M LOOKING AT GAY PORNO!". The aggressively is very reminiscent of the way Ayashii Worlders dealt with each other, however, the similarities end only with both sides' penchant for trolling.

Sometime between 18th April 2001 and 15th May 2001, Lowtax creates a sub forum called ADTRW, Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse, dedicated as the name suggests to anime and the Otaku fandom. ADTRW would develop its own jokes and culture, mainly a distinct hate for the sillier aspects of the fandom (The KAWAII DESU NEE, neko ears-wearing, awkward Otakus), acting like such being ground enough to be banned from the forums. On 2002 ADTRW would create a DC++ FTP called Raspberry Heaven, separating itself from SA's general FTP SADCHUB (Something Awful Direct Connect Hub). The name is derived from Azumanga Daioh's ending song. The FTP would have its own linked IRC hosted on MircX and later Pyoko IRC. By this time moot was already a member of both and could be seen on ADTRW and the IRC.

By 2003, the Otakus of SA would discover 2chan, becoming completely perplexed by the content filled, fast moving anonymous site. On ADTRW a 2chan appreciation thread would be created, and #raspberryheaven would come to be filled with 2chan links. Users interacted in a limited with the site, as much as their knowledge of Japanese let them. However, 2chan got in conflict with Korean communities, and they organized a massive raid. In order to protect itself, 2chan blocks all non-Japanese IPs, cutting ADTRW short from posting. To this day the Japanese only restriction still stands, and given Japanese nationalism, it won't be lifted anytime soon. Raspberry Heaven would be closed some years later as BitTorrent took over as the main method of warez and files sharing and Pyoko IRC closed its doors.

On March 2003, a Japanese teenager called RIR6 (Taichirou Kosugi) founds world2ch, a textboard hosted on US servers, with the aim of making a multi-language site for users of English and Japanese speakers. While the project became well-known on 2ch itself, the anonymous textboard format never really appealed to Westerners, due to the general preference of vanity over content on conventional forums. Additionally, westerners were used to the accounts and one-click smileys of conventional forums. Few saw the point of making time-consuming Shift-JIS art that was unable to view with the common ASCII encoding. Still, the board was a groundbreaking first in the export of the 2channel-style anonymous BBS. It's discovered by goons and other English speakers, and for a while posting between the two languages flourished. Many later influential names started out or at least passed by this site.

RIR6 had a rather basic understanding of English, and communication between the English speakers and the Japanese was very poor, but they managed. World2ch would have its own little culture between both worlds, importing 2ch memes like Giko-Neko and other SJIS. One particular meme stands above all: A crazed, engrish talking Japanese called Golgomois would come to the site demanding the Americans to remove their bases from Okinawa. The Americans in the site would come to outnumber the Japanese. They managed to convince RIR6 to open an imageboard and make various fixes. He makes two, these would be effectively the first western imageboards, or rather the first western populated ones.

RIR6 eventually lost interest and botched several fixes, making the site unnavigable, and eventually closed it on 2006. The userbase, most of its members already browsing both world2ch and 4chan, would flock to the latter.

These would be all the sites and communities that had a hand in the creation of 4chan proper. By the end of September, moot jokingly registers 4chan.net, in order to have a personal email (since pant.su was beyond his reach). Jokes aside, he gets to thinking.

## Genesis, Part Two

_(Oct 2003 –Apr 2004)_

_<moot> regging 4CHAN.net_

_<moot> FOUR CHAN_

_<moot> brace for faggotry_

4chan is founded in October 1, 2003 by moot, a 15 years old user of the DC++ hub #raspberryheaven and Something Awful's ADTRW forum. Built to be an English-language version of 2chan, moot copies 2chan's publicly available source code, Futaba, and manages to produce a meager translation. In an unsuspectingly impacting mistake, he mistranslated "Nanashii", which stands for Nameless, to Anonymous. The site introduces the simple and free method of communication that _Something Awful_ users have always dreamed of. It soon becomes wildly popular as a new home for banned ADTRW refugees and #RaspberryHeaven goons, who in turn spread word across the Internet. 4chan links quickly replace Futaba Channel and world2ch links on ADTRW and #raspberry\_heaven, even reaching Futaba itself. This occurs at the same time when Lowtax begins to crack down on several undesirables on SA, including furries, Lolicon fans and others, effectively creating a Soviet-style police state of extremely arbitrary rules which cost users their precious $10 bux. Thanks to that, 4chan quickly rose beyond the tired, old site.

Many users from Something Awful used 4chan to vent their frustration with the site. After years of being on sites like SA, GameFAQs or Newgrounds, which had a very restrictive moderation and userbases that put reputation above all, the nearly complete freedom of 4chan was a breath of fresh air. It led the young 4channers to post all manners of things, like ironically pretending to be 13 years old Otakus (Something that would get you banned on ADTRW, even if it was ironic). The most problematic content being Lolicon and guro. By day one, /b/ was already filled to the brim with such. moot didn't like the idea of having forty years old pedophiles posting loli all over the site, so he quickly declared /b/ the "retard bin" and a temporal board. He created /l/ - lolikon and /g/ - guro to redirect them somewhere else. Those boards would later give him a lot of problems regarding hosting, which led them to end up on a separate site called not4chan, hosted by a friend of moot, ultimately disassociating from 4chan.

4chan drew many of its initial users from Raspberry Heaven and Something Awful's ADTRW board, and later from world2ch users. Early 4chan thus inherited a lot of Something Awful's humour and memes, like image macros and demotivational posters. The original 4chan staff and moderators were drawn from ADTRW. The spinning head title image is an Australian ADTRW member called Roobar. The "Dot net fo'shizzle!" title image is by ADTRW poster Rick\_Feynman, who coined the term "ZOMG!" (Pronounced "Zoh my god!") in an ICQ conversation with fellow SA goon Hannibal; although they admit the term was used before then, it wasn't widely used until popularized by Something Awful and 4chan.

The cultural elements 4chan drew from SA and 2chan – Ironic silliness from ADTRW, aggressiveness from FYAD and absurd Japanese jokes from 2chan and world2ch would prove to be a very attractive mix to people bored with normal manners. During its first years 4chan would be defined as a place where people came to express themselves, to say things for which they would be ridiculed or shunned on if done in real life – Black comedy, silly attitudes and racist jokes
# 5
 solidified 4chan's reputation a place where people could be both silly and hostile, good and evil. The news of 4chan's founding fired up much of world2ch, who felt they were stealing their thunder. They quickly began to protest and make some petty attempts at raiding, but a personal visit from moot quickly calmed down the situation, ending it with some friendly advice from both sides. Thus endeth the first western chan war.

The massive popularity of 4chan quickly becomes taxing, there are many errors in 4chan's coding and moot barely knew what half of it meant. Their first host dropping them would be due to a bug that made users load thumbnails as if they were full sized images, effectively increasing bandwidth to enormous levels. Many ADTRW and world2ch members offer a helping hand, fixing code or explaining concepts. Shii, [NPH], hova and thatdog helped tweaking the source code a little, and thatdog eventually releases Futallaby, which would become 4chan's first source code. Due to the enormous bandwidth costs, moot just barely manages to keep the site alive, through ads or donations. The controversial content becomes a major point of contention, forcing 4chan out of hosting at least 3 times. The majority of the anime boards take shape during this time, and the first tenets of 4chan culture are created under influence by ADTRW, FYAD

, world2ch and 2chan. During a particularly hard time thanks to the owner of HentaiKey convincing PayPal to close moot's account, effectively suspending him of donation money, he decided he had enough of 4chan and shuts it down, killing it for a fourth time.

# The Beginnings of the Chanverse

4chan was not the first imageboard, that tittle belongs to world2ch. And neither of them would be alone for long. The creation of 4chan, which imported 2chan's source code, Futaba, led to the creation of Futallaby (created by thatdog), Shiichan, Shii's attempt at 2ch's BBS and Kareha and eventually Wakaba, created by WAHa.06x36 (Dag Ågren). All these source codes allowed for the creation of a myriad smaller chans. The first alternative imageboard was probably 1chan, founded by thatdog while he tested futallaby with moot, housing only one unique board, trains, which still lives to this day. The most important sites would be iichan (Idlechan), a site created when 4chan died on June 2004, which eventually died and became WAKAchan, an interesting concept where users would host boards on their own servers and link each other under the same banner, and 5chan, originally created by BarnacleED, it was home to the kind of Otakus ADTRW hated. He closed it when moot personally visited their IRC. The name was later taken by another user, Zadabab, associated with TheRowan, owner of HentaiKey. It required registration, was barely populated and had a wide range of pornographic boards. TheRowan used rather dirty tactics for the day, including selling mailing lists. When he saw that 5chan was not getting any posts, he decided to try and convince PayPal of dropping moot's account. He succeeded, effectively cutting moot off donation money and forcing him to take the site down. While 5chan died shortly after, WAKAchan and iichan gave birth a whole net of imageboards extending into the modern Russian chanverse, some of which still live to this day.

Other minor chans where the original 7chan, a very short-lived site that lasted a few days, and 8chan founded by WTSnacks.

## The Golden Age

_(Aug 2004 – Aug 2006)_

Regarded by many as the best years of 4chan – Something that may be easily debatable – it was the cradle of everything that shaped 4chan for the years to come. It's most iconic memes, the basis for the board's culture, who was who in the hierarchy of anonymous and its friends and enemies. The people who browsed the site during these years would later form the archetype of a 4chan oldfag.

# The Golden Age of 4chan

_(Aug 2004 – Sept 2005)_

On August 7, moot gathers a group of friends and contributors and starts 4chan again. Though not excellent, there was an increased efficiency when it came to moderation and scripting, commandeered by Team4chan. In a reactionary move towards the rise of 4chan, Lowtax makes mentioning the site a bannable offense, whilst simultaneously engaging in a crusade towards anything resembling pedophilia, such as anime girls. The increasing oppression coming from the moderators creates a constant flow of banned users fleeing to 4chan. It's free and anonymous posting, lenient moderation, and SA-influenced culture proves to be an appealing alternative to users upset with the admin's meltdown, like Colonial America for disinherited Englishmen.

Once Moot grows up to legally visit his own site, (he is 16 at this point), he slowly opens up to the 4chan community. There's a noticeable rise in popularity and new users who posted without being aware of the fads and inside jokes, which thanks to SA's inherited FYAD culture, was responded with shouts of "lurk more" or newfag
# 7
.

4chan's culture begins to stabilize at this point, as a world of hatred, anonymity, truth in opinion, and trolling. According to a poll, which some claimed was fake, the age median drops from colleague age, to high-school freshman, this did not mean, however, that the presence of underage anons was unheard of. It is an interesting counterexample to the rise of social media occurring at the same time. Some of the original users begin to thin out as they lost interest, but are just as quickly replaced by SA refugees and immigrants from sites like YTMND, Fark, and to the disgrace of many 4channers, Gaia Online. 4chan becomes a fast changing society beginning to carve out its own culture and place in the world. The stereotype of a middle class teenagers with few friends and an interest on the Internet whose daily life didn't excite them enough begins to characterize 4chan's population. Bored even from the basic Internet and its drama and gore, they flocked in looking for the obscene, the bizarre and the transgressive, the silly and absurd, the self-referencing injokes and crazy ramblings. The lack of registration process felt truly innovative and funny, so they began to see just how far they can go in that direction.

This could be safely considered the best period for 4chan. /b/ was not as massive as it is today and was comparable, in terms of traffic, with the rest of the site. All boards enjoyed a degree of content and an active and present moderation
# 8
. Many users had decent Photoshop abilities, inherited from the highly-skilled SA goons, and most of the classic memes and events took form during this period. Anyone could make a thread, bookmark it, and come back the next day to see it was still there. Memes where created in a structured way, someone would make a simple, usually silly joke, and the /b/tards would make dozen of variant images and jokes. Discussion tended to range from civilized, concise posts (While serious debate happens all the time, actual, calm discussion of a topic is something rarely seen on modern days) to ridiculous ALL CAPS sentences.

It's in this period when moot and the staff members begin to form an ideology based on anonymity. Backed first by Asan and Shii, both mods, it slowly began to become the leading mentality of most 4channers, and the population would soon change from an even proportion of tripcode users and anonymous to an anonymous majority.

# The Golden Age of /b/

_(Oct 2005 – Aug 22 2006)_

4chan's momentous golden age begins to end with moot's dismissal of admin and moderators W.T. Snacks and Shii, and the rise of the underaged Allyson to mod status. This is seen by many anons as a harbinger of impending doom. And doom seemed imminent for all; with increasing immigration, /b/ had begun to experience sharp cultural changes that left long time users bewildered and newfags unassimilated. It began to take more and more spotlight from the rest of the boards, surpassing them in traffic, userbase and content until the majority of the site browsed /b/ alone. Its traffic doubled its follow up boards, a trend that would continue until the end of the decade.

During this era, the inexperienced 4chan community gets it first take at Internet warfare in the coalition attack against _EbaumsWorld_ for its plagiarism and malicious tendencies
# 9
. Although it was a fairly reactive community, the EbaumsWorld raid gave birth to a sort of organized raid culture, with raids soon becoming commonplace on /b/. Later, in the community, a /b/tard made a thread telling how he was banned from the forum Bibliocality.com, a hardcore Christian forum. Some /b/tards though it would be funny to flood the forum, and the idea took on. Soon Bibliocality was nothing but spam and insults, with infamous tripfag Soviet\_Russia leading the charge. The Admin overreacted and locked down the forums, and the site eventually died. The thread was popular enough to merit the birth of a tradition that would be performed with bolder and bolder antics with each passing month. Such attacks culminated in a massive, quasi-coordinated raid to Habbo hotel, known as The Great Habbo Hotel Invasion of July 2006, giving birth to the Nigra meme, a common afro and suit attire that /b/tards and related 4channers would try to use when playing online games. School shooting plans and stadium bombings are posted thanks to the sense of anonymity, as in such a particular event, an user was arrested once his post was reported to the police, the ensuing drama and news reports gave birth to the "DON'T MESS WITH FOOTBALL" phrase.

The massive increase of threads proportionally increased the rate of thread deletion. Although the ratio of good to bad content changed little, the sheer magnitude of forgettable, rehashed content (What we now know as templates and macros) created class conflict between ex-SA "oldfags" and unskilled newfags. There was a hankering for a romanticized depiction of /b/ as an idyllic place where all content was original, funny, and fresh. While this belief could not be farther from the truth, the cynical ideal quickly became a major tenet of 4chan culture
# 10
. It was during this period that 4chan and /b/ became known as the assholes of the Internet. /b/ went through major cultural changes: Though at its core it was still about silliness and black comedy, its aggressiveness began to outshine everything else. /b/ attained an attack dog mentality, seeking prey to destroy, to do whatever they thought was lulzly at the time. Persecution of amusement at the detriment of everybody they deemed wanting became the biggest hobby of /b/.

4chan's nominal anonymity begins to attract a bunch of colorful groups to 4chan
# 11
, such as Touhou fans, stalkers, guro lovers, pedophiles, and worst of all, Furries
# 12
. Most of these groups are given their own boards to keep them out of the other ones, but curiously, Furries have not. A persecution complex causes them to react badly to criticism, and minor distaste evolves into total hatred that threatens to destroy the boards. Being so sensible, 4chan decided to do the sane thing and banned furries since day one. Quoting moot, "furries create drama".

/b/'s raid culture began to shine around mid-2006. The board began a series of organized raids against many sites, included but not limited to: Fandom (most notoriously ZeldaUniverse), Christian, Pro-Ana, and sites for people with disabilities. June saw the total destruction of the Zelda Guide Forums and Naruto-kun.com. Any camwhores that came to the board's attention would be trolled to tears. On July /b/ staged the great Habbo raid of July 2006, saturating Habbo Hotel with nigras, black avatars with a two piece black suit, black shoes and an Afro, because of perceived racism on part of the mods. On august 16 Canadian Tom Green gets raided at his own talk show, which would become a sort of tradition.

With an ever increasing growth, and a series of continuous raids to different people, like the Hal Turner and Tom Green raids, 4chan ended up with a Fox News coverage (and a minor G4 one) of Anonymous. With Fox News being Fox News, it was terribly inaccurate and sensationalistic. It coined the famous terms Hackers on Steroids and Internet Hate Machine, gleefully adopted by /b/, among many other memes that sprang from it.

On August 22, a splinter group of /b/tards went completely nuts and completely obliterated three sites from the face of earth, prompting anons to make threads urging /b/ to start a crusade against faggotry, and /b/ planned its Magnum Opus: A series of detailed, coordinated raids against the entirety of the furry fandom, including sites like WikiFur, Furaffinity, fchan and various forums. However, the next day proved to be somewhat different than planned.

## The /b/-day

_(Aug 23 2006 - Aug 2006)_

The golden age of [[/b/]] concluded with the notorious /b/-day: When the 4chan mods decide to impose much tighter rules, including the banning of jailbait and raids, much cherished traditions of /b/. The sticky, made by moot himself, it met with nothing short of an outrage. Dissent was an all-time high, even in the moderation ranks, which led to the thread being deleted, remade and constantly stickied and unstickied. A number of /b/tards leave 4chan for dead and abandon en masse. A declaration of independence written by exemplar /b/tard Captain\_Cornflake is made that establishes Anonymous as a separate group with its home anywhere but 4chan. Ultimately, the /b/-day failed its purpose. At this stage the users of /b/ were too numerous and aggressive to be moderated properly. When the stickies appeared, they retaliated until 4chan's img server crashed and a plethora and boards with it. Banned users and /b/-tards began an exodus, looking for other random boards such as 2ch.ru's /b/, AnonIB, iiChan or WTFux. The boards that benefited the most where a revived 7chan and a revitalized 420chan. This event foreshadowed what would become of imageboard culture during the following years. Ironically, during the following Dark Age, the other chans' diffusion of 4chan memes around the Internet will only solidify its position as the ultimate center of Internet culture.

Two days later /b/ was back again, but the board was submerged in a state of civil war, banned anonymous from 7chan script-flooded the board for days, 4chan's /b/-tards retaliating in a similar manner. The aftermath of the /b/-day was the diversification of \*chan culture, with a rise on the number of alternate image boards, or better said, alternate /b/s, such as 7chan, 12chan, 2ch.ru; a site that would become the birthplace of the Russian chanverse, 420chan, 888chan, AnonIB, WTFux, among others. The idea of independent, low population /b/s became a cultural trend on the imageboard communities that lasted for many years, having its peak during late 2006 and early 2007. The prohibition on raids also strengthened the raid mentality of those who were banned. From there on there would be a presence of the /i/nsurgency as an official group, steering from 7chan's /i/ - Invasion board. However /i/ boards where highly problematic, and 7chan's board would later be deleted. With time, every major alternative site would house an /i/ board for a while.

## The Shithole of the Internet

_(Sept 2006 – Jun 2007)_

The /b/-day marked a new stage on the Internet. Having to deal with not one but many iterations of /b/, the Internet began to consider it one of worst places of its realm. The period between 2006 and 2007 marked rapid change on 4chan, as more and more people explored the site in curiosity. Post speed increased dramatically and the ways of posting changed. 4channers would no longer speak like little kids but rather they would shout catchphrases and spam copypasta on every possible occasion. It was also a time of uncertainty – Anything could happen. 4chan could go down and they would flood 7chan, moot could go nuts and embed and mind bogglingly awful CSS with epilepsy inducing flashing colours, a mod could begin to ban everyone on the board and sticky the bans and entire sites got tricked into 4chan pranks. Sometimes 4chan jokes even got on TV. It was a chaotic times where one could truly feel anything could happen. Hilarious things like the DSFARGEG bans, the Allyson/BRING BACK SNACKS drama, the infernal rape GET and the great re/b/oot went and left a memorable mark on the memory of anyone from those times.

On the rest of the site, things were calm and cozy. /b/ haven't taken the habit of interboard raiding yet, and things still looked like they were before the /b/-day. /v/ was on its earliest days, where mods could easily moderate the board and nobody would insult you just for the sake of insulting, /a/ and /m/ where butting heads over the definition of GAR, /co/ was arguing incessantly about the quality of Marvel's Civil War crossover, /tv/ was not a haven for pedophiles and a newborn /tg/ was producing tons of anime-esque OC about Warhammer 40k.

# Intermission - The Warring States of Random

_(Sept 2006 – circa late 2009)_

The aftermath of the /b/-day ended with many banned or exiled anonymous looking for a place where they could retain their old culture. From this point on Imageboard culture would change from being relatively homogeneous, in the sense that no other alternative chan tried to compete with /b/, to divide into a series of small, very hostile sites. One of the main attributes what the existence of the /i/ - Invasion board. It was housed by many sites during the years, and had many splinter groups such as Partyvan, ultimately becoming Raidchan.

This period was characterized by a lot of interboard conflict and hacker activity, with many groups cheerfully DDOSing each other. Mayor players of the day where 7chan; known for being particularly active and hateful towards 4chan, 420chan; a drug chan, though not as active as 7chan, hosted /i/ for a while, Raidchan; IRC/Radio group of trolls, AnonTalk; run by Kimmo Alm, spammed the hell out of everyone. ImageBoards were born due to the /b/-day, such as 2-ch.ru, 888chan and 99chan, etc. or revived, as was WTFux and 7chan. The only trait in common that most of these boards had was a rotund hate for 4chan's /b/, which they considered a dead board filled with idiots.

On January 27, 2007, the great chan death of 2007 happened. Already demoralized by the similar events of November 7, 4chan has a power failure and goes offline, anons scoured the Internet looking for a worthy candidate to inherit the crown of the hubsite of Anonymous, but to no avail. Each of the other major chans were not available. 7chan went offline due to high traffic, 12chan was closed by the FBI, 420chan was kicked out of hosting, 2-ch.ru died by reasons unknown (Allegedly closed by the Russian equivalent of the FBI). Many minor sites went down due to the sudden surge of traffic, sometimes permanently. Though not very consequential, since most of the important sites came back later, it shined off a single fact: Nothing could replace 4chan's /b/. The dream of the /b/-day, of an independent Anonymous, slowly faded once the anons realized that there was no suitable substitute for 4chan.

The /i/ board would be a major player on the scene, starting out in 7chan, they would plan various raids to sites like Stickam and Tom Green's show. During the Hal Turner raids, where 7chan got a lot of fame, it was found out that /i/ violated the TOS of the host, so it had to go. 420chan created their own /i/ board and housed the /i/nsurgency for a while. Both sites died, and there was no invasion board for a while, until they returned. However this new iteration did not last long, due to protests from a new wave of users, borne out of Project Chanology achieving mainstream recognition. The new users, denominated protestfags or moralfags hate the idea of Internet raids because it would demonize Anonymous's standing in the media. This culminated with /i/ DDOSing themselves and flooding 420 with cute things like rabbit and otters in what was denominated the rabbit raid.

Later the /i/nsurgency would take place in minor chans like Freechan, 69chan, 711chan and 888chan, and IRC networks, such as Lulznet, Raidchan and Partyvan.org. During the Caturday Nap 711chan would enjoy a period of high traffic, and during the Subeta raids 420chan and 711 merged their /i/s. Months later they would split, with a very weakened 711chan retaining the board. Freechan would slowly replace the site as HQ of the insurgency, but the site died during October 2008. There won't be any major boards hosting any /i/ from then on. Ultimately, these sites would die off due to various problems, with the last remaining /i/ on the net, as of June 2013, being 888chan's.

Many raids and chan wars happened, 2007 saw the BRB, compromised incident, where moot had his domain account stolen and the Caturday Nap, where Lulznet DDoS'd 4chan, unleashing a chain reaction that would end with all the mayor sites dead or offline. In 2008 the Chanopocalypse happened, where Raidchan DDoS'd everyone out of existence, the Subeta raids, where 420 leads the charge to take back a stolen meme, and many other attacks and problems, such as AT&T blocking 4chan's img server due to AnonTalk DDOS.

The period did not truly end up until late 2009, by that time most of the original splinter \*chans died or diminished, becoming barely active, with 4chan returning as the sole place for anonymous imageboard culture, which was, however, changing drastically.

During 2007, 4chan's Internet presence reached the point where most Internet culture spawned from its womb. There wouldn't be a corner of the Internet that hasn't been touched by 4chan, be it in the form of memes or raids. An exponential growth led to a massive surge of newcomers during the American summer. This time, quality of content dropped massively, many users came from notoriously annoying sites such as AnimeZuki and Gaia Online. Even more came in expecting to find a hacker paradise. The age median lowered, going underage. Many aspects of 4chan culture, like GETs, completely disintegrated. The Raid culture was severely distorted from coordinated raids to simple zerg rushes of spam and memes, losing an important part of their effectiveness. Though there was a considerable amount of high-quality content in a self-fulfilling cycle, the sheer number of pointless threads, repost and spam made /b/ the equivalent of having to swim though an ocean of shit, just to find the diamonds that glitter.

This upheaval of new users led many other \*chans to despise /b/ even further, and began to take precautions to keep them out of their forums, like entering partyhard mode every time /b/ or 4chan was down, commonly used by 7chan with the infamous partyhard.css and 420 with the rave mode.

Not long before this, increased migration to and from 4chan had pushed its culture memes into the forefront of Internet fame. _Something__Awful_ users emulating 4chan's Caturday sparked Eric Nakagawa to create _I can haz cheezburger_, which began, and later monetized, the meme industry outside of 4chan. On the fledging site _Youtube_, 4chan users popularized Tay Zonday's Chocolate Rain and created an adaptation of the Duckroll for video, known as the Rickroll. The Rickroll would later become the most definitive meme of the era. 4chan trolls spread across the Internet to cause rage. Newfags come in expecting a hacker playground, and after the Fox News report on Anonymous, 4chan's /b/ eventually regains a strong raid mentality that the mods have given up on stopping.

The rise of the meme industry produced unwanted interest in the site that created it all. The social problems of population growth, mainstream appeal, and problematic subcultures reached its greatest crescendo during the "newfag summer", and it's seen by many users as 4chan's Eternal September.

## The Dark Age

_(Aug 2007 – Aug 2009)_

Claimed to be the true Golden Age of 4chan, but this time the term "Golden Age" does not refer to a lost time of actually funny and original content or any sense of Victorian elegance, but to a time where 4chan became the center of the Internet, and even popular culture in the same manner as 2channel in Japan.

# Project Chanology

_(2008 – 2009)_

On January 2008, a well-known video of Tom Cruise going crazy on a Scientology training video was censored on Youtube by the Church of Scientology. A raid thread was immediately posted on 4chan's /b/ detailing the other illegal and immoral acts that the group has pulled off. With near-unanimous support /b/tards began a massive operation to rid the world of the scourge of Scientology once and for all through DDoS and protest. The coming events came to be known as _Project Chanology_, resulting in major victories over Scientologists. On January 28, Mark Bunker made a video congratulating anonymous on its fight against scientology but suggested them it would be more efficient to stage actual IRL protests. Later known as the Wise Beard Man, he would come to be the only man on the history of the Internet who actually managed to control the chaotic monster that was /b/. The use of large IRL protests and mass media coverage due to these protests brought forth another massive wave of new users to 4chan, even dwarfing the newfag summer. It is regarded by many to be the time 4chan hit rock bottom, the time where they began to lose control of the direction they were heading.

As time went on, the initial enthusiasm for the raid wore off, and participants of Project Chanology realized that 4chan was not the best place for organized assault. There was a moral conflict between the "new anonymous" – Whose introduction to imageboards began with Chanology, they used a different dressing method to raid, with IRL protests, donning Guy Fawkes masks and the old anonymous, more specifically the /i/nsurgents. The former put his cause of action at the possibility of using the Internet for doing good, protesting other's intention to raid lolcows and people who didn't entirely deserve it whilst the latter still held the old values of doing it for the lulz and dubbed anyone who would try to get in their way a moralfag. These people temporarily left 4chan for separate sites, like _711chan_, various IRC channels and Why We Protest. The split established Anonymous as a powerful force for "hacktivism" independent of 4chan. Though still regarded as the Internet Hate Machine, anonymous is seen showing better lights for the first time.

This period was probably the closest 4chan has ever been to being shut down permanently. The economic crisis made sure that moot couldn't pay the server bills and put him in debt. There were running rumors claiming that 4chan had a total of 20000 dollars in debt (Which was later confirmed in a newspost in 2012, to this day I have no idea how the hell he managed to pay all that). He also put forth actual pornographic ads, something he absolutely hates, in a desperate move to alleviate the costs of maintaining 4chan. He grew increasingly disconnected with the site and sometimes spouted some lines that implied that he hated 4chan, or at least /b/, during those times.

By the end of 2008, Project Chanology has long faded with only a few stalwart holdouts and the majority of Anonymous re-assimilates into 4chan within a few months.

It's generally regarded by the majority of 4chan's population, regardless of year or board of origin, that 2008 was the worst year 4chan ever went through. The sheer size of /b/ made it collapse on its own weight various occasions. Most memes of the era failed to take off, all raids were uncoordinated at best and a complete failure at worst. Everyone on the board was either complaining about Chanology, demanding that /b/tards get their shit together and do something or blaming everyone else for being the cancer that was killing /b/. The state of the site even affected the moderation – The mods, mostly composed of the old guard from 2004 and 2005, where in a serious state of apathy, uncaring about trying to solve the problems of most boards, limiting themselves to deleting illegal content and actively rejecting any and all content created from /b/ and other boards. It's been known that janitors could be fired for something as trivial as using a meme the mods didn't like on the janitor IRC. moot was in serious debt, something he didn't reveal until 2010. Such thing could explain the reason he stopped making newsposts and his presence on the site diminished greatly. Boards would be created and be completely forgotten by the mods, like /x/ and /sp/. At the same time /b/ took a nasty habit of interboard raiding and things only got worse with the constant crashes from /b/'s server. This began to affect other's board quality, especially /v/, which would begin a downward spiral into off-topic posting and underage b& overpopulation.

# The Boxxy Civil War

_(2009)_

On January 7, 2009, a year-old video from a strangely tantalizing teenager named Boxxy came to the full attention of /b/, which in turn incited a major civil war between lovers and detractors. Normal users, tired of both sides, took down the entire site in a major DDoS and mods began to ban all Boxxy-related posts. Not long after a group of namefags calling themselves the "Center for Boxxy Control and Restriction" (CBCR) hacked into Boxxy's account and held her IRL information hostage. Their work was undermined by their radical tendencies, and support eventually broke down.

The year is characterized by the rise of Reddit, a major news and content aggregator that rose to power after the Digg Revolt, when a revamped hub led to an exodus from the site. Reddit's mainstream popularity and strong cultural influence from 4chan created a unique relationship between the two.

Culturally, 4chan was a shadow of its former self. Many things /b/tards proposed themselves to achieve ended up failing miserably. /b/'s content began to change towards inane threads, like porn dumps and camwhores. Many old users, complaining about the site's idiotic tendencies, migrated towards the ascending Reddit, remaining there until the rise of SRS. A notable exception was Time's Most Influential Person of the Year raid, where hackers and /b/tards not only made moot the most voted name, but also arranged the runner ups to spell "Marblecake also the game", a shootout to the Youtube Porn day. moot attended to the event, spawning even more memes.

## The Silver Age

# _(Sept 2009 – Jun 2011)_

Seen by some as the good, underappreciated days of the Dark Age, the Silver age was a time were /b/ reclaimed some of its original quality, mainly during 2010. A new generation of /b/tards, being neither the uncaring sociopaths of 2006 nor the legion types of 2008, rekindled with one of 4chan's original attitudes – That of the silly, uncaring prankster. /b/ would go around finding things they could exploit and make jokes of. They would find their way in and mess with a site's layout or hijack an Internet poll and put outrageous results. They would sometimes spam forced memes that ultimately would become accepted by the community and generally became a funnier crowd to be around. This didn't mean 4chan would stop being the shithole of the Internet, or that /b/ would stop being the shithole of 4chan, because for a site with such reputation it takes a long time to clean its name. If it ever wants to.

# The Anonymous Split and the Rise of Hacktivism

(Sept 2009 – Apr 2010)

With /b/ delighting in its own decadence, there was little actual action or reaction from the community. The last important action that came from 4chan's anonymous was February 2010's Operation Titstorm, the culmination of a series of bad vibes between the Internet and the Australian government that attempts to censor it, taking its origins from Operation Didgeridie.

From then on, almost all actions performed against any organization or government that attempted against free speech, piracy or relevant matter would suffer attacks made by hacktivist groups, all claiming to be part of anonymous. With Operation Payback 4chan would slowly fade out from being the main cause of most Internet warfare, with various groups taking the spotlight. Since 4chan was constantly filled with spam, uninteresting threads, and trolls the media ended up separating the site from anonymous entirely. The new hacktivist anonymous would proceed to attack government sites, Visa, MasterCard and others in retaliation to the censorship attempts during Operation Payback and WikiLeaks's loss of funding during Operation Avenge Assange. 4chan's anonymous weren't inactive, however, as they proved they still got it in 2009 by filling Youtube with porn and getting moot selected as TIME's person of the year and rigging the poll so it would spell "marblecake also the game".

# The Jessi Slaughter Saga

_(May 2010 – Jul 2011)_

4chan wasn't completely inactive, and 2010 was proved an interesting when /b/ raided Jessi Slaughter, an underage camwhore with a serious case of unwarranted self-importance, until her own father discovered her and threw a shitstorm over it, sparking the infamous phrases YOU DUN GOOFED and CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. The situation escalated to the point where Jessi and his family were interviewed at Good Morning America! Expecting a surge of NORP viewers on the site, /b/'s CSS was modified to show a more safe for work front page, and everyone was exited since most raiders where /b/tards.

This year is marked as a turning point on 4chan culture. /b/'s Dark Age culture, that of hostility, pointlessness and cancer, slowly began to fade out due to tiredness. The other boards, smaller in size compared to the giant began to see a steady amount of growth in terms of userbase. This would make a trend that would continue for a few years, with the rest of the site slowly gaining importance as /b/'s presence faded from the face of the Internet, while it did not regain quality, /b/tards began to form a new "whatever" culture, where the main tenet was that nothing really mattered, save for a few injokes.

4chan also begins to have its first skirmishes with the new generation of Internet sites like Tumblr, with whom it originally shared some likeness before the site was became the breeding ground for insane SJWs, and Reddit, where /b/ perceived something very, very wrong was growing on that site.

2011 presented a rather interesting year for the Internet as a whole. SOPA, PIPA, the rise of the brony fandom and all the crazy ideas /b/ made a reality. /b/ would enter a massive conflict with the brony fandom as trolls flocked to their side and raided the entirety of the site. Modern 4chan takes further form when the concept of a general was born in /co/ and /v/, /vg/ is created to host /v/'s massive amount of generals, /pol/ is brandished as the new nazi troll capital of the Internet and becomes a potential successor for /b/, and /r/funny explodes in popularity and sparks the meme faces phenomenon, ruining memes forever. /b/ tries to trick the Internet with various schemes, poll raids and even successfully tricking Justin Bieber fans into shaving their heads.

## Meme Faces, the Second Newfag Summer

_(Late 2011 – Early 2012)_

On the late 2000s cellphone market was making huge leaps in size and technology. By 2010 everyone and their grandmas had access to a cellphone and an Internet connection, and all those people spent their free time, during job breaks, waiting for the bus, or simply in their houses, browsing the Internet. The turn of the decade marked a vast change for the Internet. More and more memes and events were broadcasted by the old media. The Internet began to reach new corners, especially with new and more efficient Smarthphones and Apple products. During late 2011 a sudden explosion of /r/funny's prefabricated rage comics combined with the gigantic market of cellphone Internet and apps made Internet Culture hit the mainstream – Ultimately concluding the near collapse of Internet Culture.

Now that everyone is connected the Internet became truly mainstream, with (relatively) new faces such as Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit and Facebook becoming massively popular, attracting much of the youth culture. The old sites like Newgrounds, YTMND, Something Awful and Fark became a small spot in comparison to their enormity. 4chan, however, didn't. This may be due the fact that 4chan's core never had any basis for a truly solid userbase. All traditions where dictated by whatever social group was on the site all the time and mods didn't enforce any kind of culture beyond what was specified by moot's site rules, making the site flow along in the direction the Internet as a whole went. Every three years or so as the site got more popular the userbase of 4chan would be completely unrecognizable from what it was before.

The site _I can haz cheezburger,_ which managed to successfully monetize meme culture, spawned a series of content aggregators with a simple model which became notoriously popular with the rise and consolidation of the social sites Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. Reddit was a site that could be considered a "moderate" 4chan, where people made similar jokes and had a propensity for black comedy but never went off the rails. These sites became known for utilizing and popularizing the rage comic format
# 13
, along with many of the rage faces and trollface variants that existed. The popularity of said comics became massive, spreading to Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and even real life with many pieces of merchandise based off them. This prompted a third wave of new users curious about the source of all those memes, probably reading about them on Reddit or Cheezburger's _Knowyourmeme._ Unlike what /b/ was used to these users were more moderated, a part of the "Mainstream", with little semblance or knowledge of Internet culture. They arrived at the same time the popularity of the worst aspects of 4chan's Dark Age began to die. On the bad side the site became flooded with NORP teens, prompting a considerable increase of moralfags and people without a sense of humour on /b/. Meme culture kept evolving on content aggregators like 9Gag and /r/funny, distortions which 4chan and even Reddit have grown to hate. The old userbase never left, but was easily outnumbered by the new twitter-addicted youth.

This year also saw a growing concern with social justice in sites like Tumblr, Reddit and Something Awful, but apparently it's most vocal defenders don't what how what social justice even means. Allegedly the movement had its origins on Something Awful; where Lowtax, who stopped caring about the site long ago put a radical feminist as second in command, making the stupidly elitist and closed-minded community even more elitist and closed-minded. A bunch of users discovered /r/ShitRedditSays, a community about stupid or ignorant comments made by redditors that managed to get upvoted, and proceed to influence it, enabling a sort of hostile, intolerant cult mentality surrounding feminism that took over SRS and various subreddits. This is quite saddening, since SA is one of the fathers of western Internet culture. At the same time Tumblr, the successor of BlogSpot, became the birthplace of a particularity insane breed of feminist dubbed the "SJWs", Social Justice Warriors. These people, usually LGBTs, rape and abuse victims, young girls that couldn't deal with normal life and of course, idiots, preached very erratic ideas about political correctness, gender fluidity and self-victimization. Being the capital of all kinds of fandoms, 4chan's media dedicated board's /co/ and /tv/ suffered a great increase of far left users and SJWs, with all that it implicates. By 2012 /co/ was heavily populated with Tumblr users forgetting many aspects of common 4chan culture.
_ **# 14** _ This saw a massive rise in the numbers of troll threads as SJWs are physically unable to ignore any sort of bait that usually reach +300 posts.

## The Reactionary Era

_(Feb 2012 – Jan 2014)_

With the Internet becoming mainstream 4chan's role in the new e-geopolitics was well defined. People from all the world would come to express their problems, desires or just to talk about normal things or things they wouldn't normally talk about protected by the veil of anonymity. While not something negative in and on itself this would bring forth one of the most radical changes of /b/, and in a way 4chan: A relative disassociation from the Internet Culture that once gave it birth.

Culturally the average user of 4chan has radically changed his attitude. It has become much more sensitive and incapable of ignoring things it doesn't like or enjoy, sometimes to the point of being humorless. They also became much more interested discussion, debate and creating content for 4chan even though people with actual Photoshop, coding or drawing skills are few and far between. While not worse than the previous ages, 4chan lost some its passion for black comedy and transgression, and users take most things others say personally. Every thread has some form of antagonism by someone who didn't like it. However the boards didn't stop from creating their characteristic content, perhaps even more than all the other yeaars ever did.

#

# The Reforms

_(Feb 2012 – Sept 2012)_

The advent of SOPA and PIPA
# 15
 led most important sites of the Internet to react in some way to it. Anonymous was not excluded, and it culminated with massive protests, a black-out were even sites like Wikipedia participated in for a day, and DDOS attacks to most US government sites. The law was eventually rejected but another, weaker version was proposed and a similar one was also projected in the European Union. To this day most governments and organizations continue to attempt to censor and control the Internet, but the hacktivist anonymous still puts up some fight.

In February, Valentine's Day, moot announces plans to add up to 15 boards and manage the rising brony problem that was created from the new _My Little Pony_ series. Three days later he adds /mlp/ - My little Pony. This would be the first move a series of actions that would, after six years of spam, chaos and reposts, ameliorate the situation of /b/ and 4chan as a whole. moot would later reinstitute forced anon on /b/, open /q/ - 4chan Discussion, make several enhancements to the source code, implement inline plug-ins, open a sticky to discourage porn, rate me, and whatever spam threads were left, reopened the janitor applications and reactivated the mod machine. After many years without gaining any money other than ads revenue, because moot hates the idea of receiving without giving (If you know what I mean), he add adds the 4chan pass under suggestion from /q/ allowing people to bypass reCAPTCHA by paying 20 dollars. Though not without its problems, many semi-popular boards suffer from spam due to various events that destabilized them (Andrew W.K. and Deadmau5 posting on /mu/, the Olympics on /sp/, etc) Yet, for the first time in years, the quality of /b/ has returned to pre-newfag summer levels, with new OC slowly making its way through the sea of threads. CP threads are no more, spam is almost inexistent, and the oldest users seem to be returning. However this small period of peace soon proved to be little more than an ephemeral activity.

The rise of Anita Saarkesian, feminist vlogger, and her successful kickstarter brought the issue of feminism to the completely unrelated board of /v/. /v/ being the board with the most dynamic age range (from 13 years olds to people in their late 20s) took it as something personal. From the on there will always be a thread on /v/ complaining about feminism, sometimes not even games related.

# The State of /b/

_(Approx. Oct 2012)_

With the issue of bronies quelled, and new coder desuwa working constantly on the inline extension, among other ideas such as an inline catalog, the last part of 2012 proved to be one of improvements. The end of the year saw a high rise on the numbers of "casual" users on the board, to the point that posting old memes and catchphrases would shock /b/ as if it was the first time they were ever posted. Since one of the tenets of /b/ was that their aggressiveness would often create content or at least humorous threads, the rising amount of normal users reduced /b/ to become more or less an anonymous Facebook divided between porn threads and "X decides what I do". Before, all users have to do was to be patient and eventually good threads would arise. Nowadays that idea seems to be a distant possibility.

By the end of 2012 /b/ accepted it's more casual culture, the influx of what could be deemed as "Facebook users", bored teenagers with a knack for dark comedy and an age median of 16 to 24, put the board in a routine of meaningless activities. While quality wise its nothing new, as even during the days of the dark age with /b/ at its worst there was at least some degree of activity in any form – Be it raids, OC, discussion or even cancer – Nowadays /b/ has shifted towards a culture of passive encouragement: It will take any opportunities that present themselves, but it will not go out to generate any new content (or problems) like it used to do, merely limiting itself to laugh at stuff and make porn threads.

# /pol/'s War Against the Internet

_(Approx. Jan 2013)_

The advent of 2013 also saw a sharp rise with issues regarding the board /pol/ - Politically Incorrect. /pol/ was created to re-contain a small band of white supremacists taking residence on boards like /int/ and /k/. They were originally from /new/ - News, a board that housed a majority of white supremacists allegedly because 4chan once raided Stormfront, making a few of its users aware of the site's anonymous appeal.
# 16
 Given the cultural changes of the Internet and the rise of Reddit's "fempire", nobody expected what would happen next.

The general perception of /pol/ was as a quarantine board disguised as a politics board. In due aspect most users of the site regarded /pol/ as a shithole. This board came to be notorious in various Internet communities prompting various sites with a tendency towards Social Justice
# 17
 to go on a crusade against the board's perceived white supremacism. Since /pol/ is constantly being showered with spam the residents, most of them trolls, didn't particularly care, after all to them it was just more entertainment. All this managed was to increase the popularity of the JIDF
# 18
 meme. However the repercussions of having both groups chimping out on each other like Hatfields and McCoys would be felt site-wide, with various boards having a team of /pol/lacks appearing whenever race or politics were mentioned, and many threads being constantly derailed by complaining feminists and liberals. /co/ would be the place the issue was felt the most, with both groups clashing and completely derailing threads.

moot and the moderation team, and most of 4chan's userbase originally though the JIDF/SRS raids were nothing but trolls and a minority of actual stormfags being idiots reacting to everyone hating them
# 19
. Eventually, after a series of threads on /q/
# 20
 people began to suspect that there were actual people attempting to get /pol/ deleted. Investigation followed, more info came out, with users from /pol/ compiling and links and evidence towards the possibility of organized raids against the thread. Finally, a mod took note of all the information and vowed to direct it to moot
# 21
. Ultimately /q/ would suffer a constant onslaught of Social Justice Warriors (or a very dedicated troll) trying to get /pol/ deleted to the point where even the mods stepped in to tell them to shut up. The SJW didn't stop and some even began to threaten to doxx team 4chan and start legal action. This eventually got moot fed up enough to delete /q/ on mid-2013. To this day moot still calls /q/ a mistake that went from 4chan discussion to /deletepol/.

The constant onslaught by not one but two different groups made serious discussion on /pol/ nearby impossible, however all that would be rendered moot (no pun intended) as it all became a meme in and on itself and the discussions eventually drowned in a sea of IT'S HAPPENING and troll threads. It can no longer be distinguished whenever a /pol/itician is joking or not. /pol/ also saw a rise in conspiracy and tin-foil-hat-type threads spurn from an exodus of neo-/x/philes, a very crazy breed of anon, to the board. Many modern /x/ phrases such as "disinfo" have been exported to /pol/ and the quality of board plummeted thanks to them.

Ultimately, the consequences of all the strife ended up with /pol/ becoming a buzzword for any dissenting, right-leaning opinion and Tumblr/SRS becoming the equivalent buzzword for any left-leaning post. The whole debacle ended up becoming just another way for posters to maintain and rationalize their idealized idea of their favourite board. To this day it's still a mystery whether the spammers were feminists or some of the most persistent trolls 4chan has ever seen.

# /s4s/

_(Apr 1st 2013)_

For April's fool 2013 moot embedded an Adult Cat Finder joke on /b/ and grand surprise: The creation of a board called "Shit 4chan Says". Obviously a take on all the SRS and Reddit hate the rule-less board was immediately filled with /b/tards of old and people looking for old jokes and traditions from all ages. Threads from Thrust Vectoring to copypasta spam and she EPIN, /b/ where posted and the whole place looked like a time vortex suddenly appeared began to spam dead memes and dubs threads. All was good and the general opinion of the board was positive. However the board depopulated quickly as nobody expected it last long and 4chan's interested have long went away from old memes. Since it was an April's fool's board, nobody knew how much the board would last. A general mood of "post-irony" where all 4chan customs where inverted and shitposting was renamed funposting set in. Knowing the lifespan of the board was potentially short its new userbase quickly decided to create as much OC as possible.

/s4s/'s immediate exports were the mod-created Into the Trash You Go, discovering the kek muffin and using it to replace lel and top lel, the return of That Fucking Cat and breaking the 10000 replies mark. Many of 2006 and 2008's users stayed and tried to bring back raids, and while this worked for some time, people were not interested and the mods quickly brought the threads down. However /s4s/, now [s4s], decided to bring back interboard raiding, this time in the form of GET stealing. Many important gets were hijacked by /s4s/, and unlike normal raids these took much longer to be deleted. /s4s/ also gave a warm welcome to the new boards, spamming the entire catalog of /gd/ with a gigantic Bateman combo, which was probably the most epic raid of the year.

By far, [s4s]'s greatest contribution was the popularization of Doge
# 22
. A reaction face of a Shiba dog with a concerned look and silly, broken dog speak in comic sans that quickly spread over all 4chan and the entire of the Internet. It got so popular it managed to get its own cryptocurrency by 2014.

# Better Moderation

(2013)

By April moot commanded a moderation crackdown on long-forgotten boards such as /tv/ and /sp/. /tv/ had become a hub for stalkers, pedophiles and celebrity/waifu worshipers and /sp/ became a shitposting haven around 2011. /sp/ was over moderated, however, with many long-standing traditions being regarded as off-topic and deleted, such as power level thread and current events like natural disasters being regarded as games. The board instantly rebelled, and began to spam both /q/ and /sp/ with off-topic and propaganda under the banner of "#freesp". /tv/ followed suit but they had no real reason to. The situation escalated to the point where users, calling themselves outlaws, got an ex-janitor into their ranks that began to leak information about the janitor board, /j/, and the staff. A full list of the staff logged in the janitor IRC, #janiteam, was gathered. Eventually moot settled the issue during his third Q/A on May stating he will consider allowing the more traditional threads.

Mods would take a much more active approach towards the boards. Whenever a big event happened a sticky would be created on its respective board until the hype wore out, or to squelch an over exited general. Mod presence generally became more noticeable, with /s4s/ getting its own resident mod. moot also added a suggestion box which allowed users to explain their concerns, perceived issues, and ideas in depth without the usual white noise /q/ had. Rizon's official 4chan IRC would also undergo changes, all of the mods would be de-opped in favour of a single bot, Yotsubot, that could be remotely controlled by them.

# 10 Years

_(October 2013)_

By the end of August, with 4chan's tenth birthday only a month away, moot announced that he will host a final 4chan panel together with Shut, on AnimeWeekend. This was followed by a couple newsposts, the 500000000 GET on /b/, and second wave of updates and upgrades to the site. Meta threads would be allowed again since /q/ was removed, and in a day that will live in infamy, moot decided to make the sage invisible, since it has long since lost its original meaning. The panel went smoothly and moot did a meet and greet with many fans, even signing a /k/ommando's Mossin Nagant. On the very same day, the American government would shut down most of it non-essential services, /v/ discovers hints that Half-Life 3 may be on the making, the Silk Road is closed by the feds and many games are released or updated. October 1st, 2013 would be a quite iconic day on the short-term memory of 4chan. /b/'s presence is long gone from the face of the Internet and its successors being one of the most hated Internet forums on history and the other an isolationist circlejerk.

## The Scapegoat Age

(Feb 2014 –Jan 21 2015)

2014 was marked with problems for the site. 4chan has long ago cemented a reputation of being the shithole of the Internet, and the majority of the netizens dismiss the site as such. This has led to a problematic case: Whenever someone wants to spread dirty information on someone or has data that could cause a major problem, they drop them on /b/. /b/'s culture tailored itself to encourage anything that would cause chaos (and make porn threads), while the rest of the side kept on with the general "with us or against us" mentality with rather dire consequences and strong reactions whenever moderation crackdowns happened. Several boards would end up hating moot out of misconceived ideas about the site's purpose, and wild mass guessing and rumor spreading would run amok. A general feeling of betrayal set up on many boards, and moot gets labeled as an SJW due to his connections to the tech world and the games industry, which has mixed greatly with Internet Culture. This in turn led moot to abuse the rebelling boards. The beggining of 2015 marks the most tumultuous period in 4chan history, when 4chan's owner and admin for 11 years, mood, steps down from adminhood.

# The Fappening

(Aug 31 2014 – Sept 2014)

On August 31, a /b/tard makes a thread declaring that he has the nudes of celebrity Jennifer Lawrence and several others, and he will proceed to post them if they gave him certain amounts of bitcoins to his account. The situation explodes to incommensurable levels as the whole event gains immediately attention from the old media, and on top of that, the hacking scene that was behind obtaining those nudes, realizing that the cops will be on their ass very soon, declare the scene dead and proceed to dump all their content. For shits and giggles, they decide to post it on /b/. The Internet pretty much explodes when it finds out, and 4chan is swarmed with millions of people from the outside trying to get the pics, overloading the site. This also leads to no end of trouble to moot, as Jennifer took the event awfully and began to threaten everyone with lawsuits, including 4chan. The result is months of behind the scenes negotiation with the lawyers (which moots suggests in a "Fappening related stress" sentence in a Q/A regarding his lack of activity). Nobody knows why the original buyer dumped his personal batch. Some suggest it was because his buy was filled with fakes. Over the following months there would be several other leaks, adding to 5 in total. The hacking where made through Apple's Cloud system, which Apple fervently denied claiming it was impossible. Moot's only public activity regarding the site was saving the hashes of several Jennifer Lawrence pics and making it so users are unable to post them, and banning everyone who evaded the prohibition.

The Fappening had quite an impact in the 4chan staff, as Jennifer Lawrence's legal pressure made them realize how easy everything could come down.

# GamerGate

(Aug 20 2014 – Oct 2014)

On August 20, a Tumblr called the Zoe Quinn Post is made by her ex-boyfriend, exposing game developer Zoe Quinn as a liar and manipulator, having slept with at least 5 men in the games industry in order to promote her content. Surprisingly, no one of the gaming press speaks about it, and many, including Kotaku, IGN and others jump on her defense. This escalates extremely quickly as dozens of people being to tell accounts regarding their experience with her and her group of friends' abuse – Sparking a massive Twitter war between e-celebrities and Zoe's clique, among them Phil Fish and many important members of the indie games' community and SJWs that believe Zoe's claims of harassment. /v/, the games board, revels in the chaos like it always does: By pointing at it and laughing. Moderators take a semi-passive stance by letting the gossip die out naturally without letting it crash the board. The jokes were dying down when things took a strange turn: Quinn decides to blame /v/ as one of the main instigators of her harassment, going as far as pretending to be hacked by the board. This sparks /v/ to act and start an enormous crusade with the objective to expose Quinn as a cheating whore. Their objective soon grows to a movement to clean the indie games industry of its blatant corruption.

The movement, being extremely reminiscent of /b/'s Chanology, is shunned by an important part of the board's population. The tensions escalates continuously, especially when /pol/ users convinces the movement to back a pro-feminism studio's campaign to make games conceived by women. This leads, as a bonus, to the creation of Vivian James as a reward for backing the Fine Young Capitalist's kickstarter. Moderators seem indecisive regarding the issue, banning it but then allowing it again. It was the found out that the mods wanted to contain the whole subject to a single thread, but due to miscommunication with the janitors, all threads ended up deleted. The ongoing tension between both parties in /v/ reaches a boiling point when the limited tactics the movement can employ (the zerg rush) interferes directly with 4chan's moderation as they mass report posts. This leads to the final ban on GamerGate on September 16. Under the notion that it would give the users cause to rally against the staff, RapeApe decides against informing the site, in spite of a majority of staff members predicting that users would be even more upset, especially since the staff already gave an modposted ok for the threads. As predicted, this is felt as a betrayal by the pro-movement /v/irgins which leads them to spam the entire site for weeks. moot later backs RapeApe's standing, under the notion that given that the users are unreasonable, nothing they say can appease them and will probably be used against them
# 23
. moot makes a sticky on /v/ declaring GamerGate against the "no raids" rule. This leads to the movement's exodus to 8chan, a "make your own board" site led by Hotwheels, a heavily crippled 20 years old. From there on the movement would get increasingly weaker as imageboard, by design, don't allow much in terms of organization, which the GG opponents managing to shun the entire movement through the media.

One of GamerGate's consequences was that moot disabled all the mods from posting, officially ending all communication between the staff and 4chan. Another consequence would be that many Team 4chan members would go rogue and leak information on 8chan due to dissatisfaction with the ban. Leaks included 2 years' worth of janitor #janiteam logs. Behind the curtains, being on #janiteam during major shitstorms is now required for all janitors in order to properly coordinate containment.

# The End of an Era: moot Resigns 4chan

(Jan 21 2015)

On 4chan, a massive announcement is made titled "NEWS POST: The Next Chapter, aka moot's retirement", where moot announces he will permanently retire from 4chan's main administrator position, declaring that his last two years of activity in the site where made with the idea of 4chan surviving him in mind. He gives some data and info regarding the site and declares that it's economically sound enough to give authority to someone else. He declares that some of his senior mods, the main coder (Mr. VacBob), the moderator manager (RapeApe) and the server administrator (unknown) will take the reins of the site from then on. He however says that he will probably return to the siteHe ad

as an Admin Emeritus. moot's favourite boards /b/ and /a/, get music embedded on them and /a/ in particular is renamed to "It /a/ll comes to nothing." Finally, he announces that he plans a final livestreamed Q/A session on Friday afternoon. On Friday 23 a special board, /qa/ - Questions & Answers is made for people to ask questions for moot's livestream. The stream lasts 8 hours all the way into Saturday. When the Q/A session finished and moot saying his final farewells, the mods put the board on archive. For weeks, entire site mourns the loss of their leader.

The reasons for moot's departure are several. Since August he has been on a non-stop onslaught of stress, having to massive events like the Fappening and GamerGate at the same time, dealing with Jlaw lawyers in real life and with GG trolls on the site. On top of that, he has been having, as per the #janiteam leaks, serious disagreements with the staff. Chief among them was forbidding the staff from modposting, which was nearly unanimously disapproved of. moot's constant disagreements with the staff must had led to him realizing he's far too impersonal and behind the doors when giving orders. The final straw probably came with the wave of resignations of January 16, when moot informed the staff they now had to sign a legal agreement. moot's plan is not only to quit as an administrator but also quit as a CEO, leaving the site entirely. The three senior mods who will be in charge would form a society and 4chan would be passed on to it. It yet remains to be seen whether or not moot's departure will lead to changes in the way the moderation works. Judging by the leaks, it's a possibility.

### _The Generations of 4chan:_

Nowadays, it's a common thing to hear, "I want neo-/v/ to leave, modern /co/ is shit, /b/ is not what it was". However, something many people ignore, is that such things have been said constantly since day one.

Except for the "originfags", the goons and Otakus that populated 4chan on its genesis, all generations of 4channers will have their forerunners telling them they are the cancer that killed their favourite boards. If we look all the time such things have been said, we can form a small conclusion: 4chan sports a liquid, perpetually evolving culture. It holds no real solid traditions, it's not designed to. The ephemerality, the anonymity and the lack of registration give no real form of preservation when it comes to a community's culture. In such way it's pointless to claim a board should behave in any form since (moot's orders excluded) there no real specific way for them to behave. A board's traditions are always defined by its current population, and given that 4chan exists mostly as a time killer, people with certain traditions eventually leave when they find something more interesting or get bored. While not all of them leave, the remaining users are too small in number to properly educate or assimilate the incoming, ever increasing userbase. The opposite happens, and the old userbase is assimilated by the limited understanding of the new userbase.

Here's a summary of what generations are perceived by most 4channers
# 24

- 2003 – 2004 – The Weeabos / The originfags

4chan's original population, mostly composed by a bunch of expats from SA's ADTRW, FYAD boards and #RaspberryHeaven. They mostly used 4chan as an image dump, and usually for silly jokes. A tendency for transgression and stupidity, two things heavily shunned by the ban happy SA community, were always present on the board.

Often, a 4channer would just dump images on a thread, and the coding was so flunky that sometimes images were managed to be uploaded after another image was posted and uploaded. There wasn't much for discussion on the boards, people would post a joke or a funny pic and it usually got around 5 posts, there wasn't much for discussion, as harsh and dissenting opinions were often banned, after all 4chan's userbase did come from Something Awful. In some boards, discussion was banned in its entirety.

- 2005 – 2006 – The Legion / The oldfags

The most easily recognizable 4channer stereotype, the new breed of 4channer came in looking for thrill. One of their most characteristic traits was a never ending curiosity for the morbid. The newly named /b/tards would travel the corners of the Internet looking for strange, bizarre things such as the now infamous BAAAWWWW diaper furry comic to show to their peers. Many weird crews settled on the site, including the very creator of that comic and a handful of stalkers that discovered Cracky-Chan and still stalk her to this day.

Oldfags usually posted and briefly discussed a topic, and whenever the discussion was finished and someone wanted to change a topic, they would say "this is now an X thread" and began to dump images. There were big fans of mega threads and roleplaying, such as playing along in Epic Fail Guy threads or setting huge things like the pickle surprise post. They usually came with a single OP post – "Let's shoop this guy's face into pictures of X", such threads, fed by sheer force of boredom, usually bore tons of new content. Their knack for shooping would be noticeable on every big meme or event that happened. For every original image there would be three or four slightly retouched variants.

They also had a prominent troll mentality. Whenever they found anyone that could easily fall for troll bait, they would milk them to no end. The first recorded raid was the Bibliocality raid, which ended up with the forums permanently closed. 4channers had a characteristic appreciation of camwhores, or anything with a vagina and a pretty face.

They were also heavy on traditions, being the first give the suffix –chan to any camwhore, and giving each day of the week having a particular theme, including things like Caturday, Warhammer Wednesday (Which would one of the motivations for the creation of /tg/), Soviet Sunday, etc.

- 2007 – 2009 – The Cancer / The newfags

Borne of Chanology and the newfag summer, this generation was characterized by talking much and achieving little. Users spent most of the time arguing between each other, trolling, spamming copypasta and whenever the topic turned towards /b/'s diminishing quality, passing the blame to each other. Discussion about all topics abounded, usually filled with lies and trolling. They spent a lot of time arguing, fighting and at the same time idolizing the oldfags, and while they tried to do the same things they did, their sheer laziness and tendency to take raids and OC for granted made them accomplish little.

They were mostly known for cheap trolling attempts, copypasta spamming (Which was probably the most produced OC of the era), zerg rushes instead of raids and considering the mods a force that could not get in their way. One of the things people of 2007 created the most was creepypasta, which got a big following like Warhammer Wednesday before had, and eventually ended up with the creation of /x/ - Paranormal.

These users were usually very strange IRL – Just look at any videos on Youtube like the /b/oston fail party or the Otakon meets up (Sadly, what was probably the best example of the average /b/tard during these days, a meet up from Otakon 2008, was deleted). One of the biggest problems with them was their affinity for illegality and child pornography – It wasn't uncommon to find such threads at least once per day, with people casually discussing as it was just another shitting dicknipples. One of the bad things is that they completely assimilated the concept of interboard raiding, which they usually did whenever /b/ was down.

In contrast, with the rise of Chanology, many users though of 4chan and imageboard in general as a bastion of good, a place where they could fight things like Scientology. This people was commonly referred to as raidfags, and later moralfags. They disappeared as soon as Chanology ended, since image boards were too hostile for them.

- 2010 – 2011 – The Pranksters / The noprefixfags
 An underdog generation if there was any, usually considered part of the newfag wave (hence the lack of any particular prefix). It was a generation with no real strong opinions on anything.

They mostly tagged along to whatever crazy shenanigans others were up to. People from then usually found a site or got an idea and immediately posted it on /b/. /b/tards would try and see what they could do. Mostly hit or miss, unlike their hated antecessors they didn't particularly care or complain about failure. In cue with their habit of tagging along, /b/tards were fond of rolling threads, where they would decide what to do or how to call a new meme with whatever was posted on a determinate number. Threads like fap roulette threads, You laugh You Lose, EFG and rage threads where found in abundance. Eventually such threads would begin to saturate the board and came to be shunned by the userbase, but there seemed to be no way to stop it.

This people's greatest achievements was the Youtube Porn Day, making moot Time's Person of the Year and the Jessi Slaughter Saga. They also got a handful of memorable CSS hacks, such as the PUDDI PUDDI invasion and Souljaquest.mp3.

- 2012 – Present – The Casuals / The normalfags

Seemingly the last generation of 4chan, since it's composed of NORPs, people not in touch with Internet culture – The lowest common denominator of the Internet food chain. Casuals look and act like what you would expect of the average American teenager and young adult.

They like to talk and share personal experiences, such as bizarre events in their life and sexual conquests and exploits, and green text stories are probably their biggest contribution as of yet. What they have in personal experience they lack in humour, as many of them actively reject the older generation's affinity for black comedy, fake racism and transgression. They lash out against anything openly hostile or dark, labelling it as edgy. They have a big tendency to jump in and give strong opinions about something without actually bothering to check their facts. Most of them have little to no skills, depending of the mercy of the few photoshoopers and coders the site may be at the time. Though the sheer size of the userbase obfuscates the fact, as there's talent available just by rule of probability.

Unlike the other generations, which were mostly confined to the less moderated boards and /b/, while the other boards had their own userbase, the casuals have spread over the entirety of 4chan, leaving very few boards untouched.

# Pre-History

1995 - A man named Masayuki Shiba creates a home party (Dedicated host website from Internet Service providers) on provider Nifty-Serve, called Ayashii World (あやしいワールド- Ayashii Warudo - Strange World), dedicated to a popular Japanese underground game called Kasumigaseki, a game based on the Tokyo Subway Sarin gas attack. He closes it soon after.

Aug 21, 1996 - Masayuki Shiba recreates Ayashii World in the form of a BBS, inspired by a previous BBS called Japan Lolita Complex Graphics, run by Pedo Koushaku (Duke Pedo) It did not run on Nifty-Serve's Posoko-Tsushin service but instead was hosted on the Internet through a variety of free web services. With the intention of sharing CP and discussing technology and warez, Ayashii World was entirely dedicated to Japanese Geek culture.

Nov 30, 1996 - The first underground web portal called A Door to an Underground (地下道入口, Chikadou Iriguchi), dedicated exclusively to cracking, hacking and technology, died. Its user flocked to Ayashii World, and the discussion topics shifted from CP to less morally upsetting things
# 26
. With the culture and the ability to post anonymously and without registration, this can be marked as the beginning of modern Japanese Internet Culture and mark Ayashii as the direct forerunner of 2ch and 2chan. Ayashii would operate as a Something Awful equivalent to the sites.

Dec 23, 1996 - Digital Eden, Ayashii World's anonymous BBS provider closes and Shiba adopts Kenjinkai.

Dec 26, 1996 - Eventually, the shift in the populace led Shiba to divide Ayashii into two BBS, one called 97 for popular topics and another called 2000, for hacking and technology. 2000 would later become the Gesu (scum) board, where the Japanese Internet would see the birth of its raid culture. Gesus carried on invasions, mass trolling and hacking.

March 1997 - Strife between Ayashii and 2000 about BBS host changes would lead the users of 2000 to create the Guess BBS, which signaled the birth of the legendary Japanese cracking/hacking group Guess. There a group of the same name discussed and conducted website hackings and invasions. By this time, many similar anonymous BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashii Warudo (Nameless World), they develop a culture based on memes, JSIS art and geek culture. Ayashii World functions as the hubsite of the Nanashii World in a similar way to how 4chan would later function as the hubsite of Anonymous. AW's popularity increases exponentially.

March 26, 1997 – Kenjinkai shuts down, some claim Ayashii had something to be with it. Ayashii proceeds to use its own servers. By this point, Ayashii World becomes a household name and many other sites are created under its name.

Aug 5, 1997 – Mr. Amezou starts Amezou BBS, at the time, a normal anonymous BSS.

Aug 1997 – The first imageboard, Licentious Notice Board, is created by Mr. Fujinami. Its userbase exceeds at image collages and the site becomes a fad on the Japanese Internet. However LNB is short lived and no new imageboards are created due to a split between its userbase.

Mar 1998 - Ayashii World enters a war with Guess BBS, due to Guess sysop Mr. Alice creating an auto-posting script and using it to spam Ayashii.

Apr 1998 – Despite Shiba's attempts at stopping his enraged users, Ayashii Worlders overdo it and dox Guess's administrator, manipulating a RL picture of him. This shocks the Japanese Internet, who held their identities in high secrecy. Mr. Alice does not take it kindly, and the threat of lawsuit gets Shiba to shut the site down.

Apr 24, 1998 – Shiba recreates Ayashii as Ayashii World Main BBS. The Ayashii World sites would grow exponentially, as the Japanese become more accepting of the Internet, and things become more chaotic.

Sept 3, 1998 – Shiba abruptly brings Ayashii World to an end, citing in his final posts that the site has grown too hostile to contain.

Sept 6, 1998 - The Ayashii World is left core-less and in disarray. They need a replacement. They get their replacement with Amezo, the First Channel, ran by Amezou-shi. It starts off as a small BBS and a bunch of links to alternative BBSes for wayward Ayashii Worlders, but it changes it's posting system from a pile-up BSS form to the floating thread BBS, dependent on bumping and saging. Its popularity increases exponentially and it soon one of the main BBSs. The floating thread feature would be an important step in the development of text and imageboards.

Sept 20, 1998 – Shiba announces he will be quitting the Ayashii World for good and leaves, with many sister sites to Ayashii closing their doors soon after.

Sept 29, 1998 – Shiba founds Magmania, one of the first Japanese personal review sites, a new start from scratch after Ayashii. However Mr. Alice, still angered at being doxed and ridiculed, pressures him declaring an official apology on the BBS and via phone. This would lead to Shiba to quit the Internet for good. Mr. Alice would continue to raid anyone defending Shiba.

Dec 7, 1998 – Continued pressure from Alice made Shiba request to all Ayashii Worlders to stop using the Ayashii World suffix. Reluctantly, most Ayashii BBSs complied. Those who didn't would be constantly harassed by spammers and hackers. Alice has never admitted to committing any kind of pressure towards Shiba, though the evidence was blatant. Mr. Alice becomes the equivalent of the devil to Ayashii Worlders

Jan 24, 1998 – The Ayashii World sites are reduced to one: Honten. Honten removes the tag after announcing that Alice had gotten hold of their password and access codes. Soon after that Hoten users created AyashiiWorld#REBIRTH. REBIRTH endures several DDOSs and raids, but eventually manages to surpass Honten in size, mainly thanks to an ads campaign and the introduction of anime logo which attracted several Otakus, previously shunned by Shiba and the userbase.

Apr 14, 1999 – REBIRTH's admin turns out to be a tyrant, so many Ayashii Worlders flock to AyashiiWorld@familie. Its administrator, Mr. Kuhuza, allegedly a well-spoken female, was deemed "moe" by the userbase.

Apr 29, 1999 – REBIRTH closes. While it was a very important BBS to the Ayashii World, it came to a miserable end. This would be the last BBS whose influence would have any impact on the culture 2ch and 2chan would come to have. Rifts between Shiba fundamentalists and the other, otaku-friendly Ayashii Worlders would continue for a while. Later in the year, the Ayashii World would recover and new sites would spring up, including Ayashii World II, The First Experience of Ayashii (a sort of Ayashii time vault), and REMIX

May 30, 1999 - Mr. Hiroyuki (ひろゆき- Hiroyuki Nishimura) creates 2 channel (2ちゃんねる – Ni Channeru - The Second Channel). It used code based on the first (Amezo), with enough servers this time to handle the exponential growth. Due to Hiroyuki's desire to create a more general discussion oriented userbase, 2ch attracts a sizeable population of Otakus and begins to separate culturally from the Nanashii World. Even though Hiroyuki had FOX ★ and an army of janitors, threads were pretty much unmoderated and trolling ran rampant. Due to the differences between userbases, Ayashii Worlders, which remain mainly geeks, regard 2channelers with animosity. Meanwhile, on the western hemisphere, Lowtax creates Something Awful.

Oct 10, 1999 – Amezo BBS shuts down due to vandalism. It being one of the very few floating thread BBS, many users try to keep the system alive by creating other sites, but they eventually flock to 2ch. Later, Hiroyuki admits having raided Amezo persistently. Amezo-shi, angry and jealous at 2ch, allies with Mr. Kazuhiko Nishi, founder of ASCII Corporation, on an attempt to attack 2ch, creating 1ch.tv. However it was not successful, as posting standards where strict and they would later charge a fee to post. There were also rumours that the Yakuza threatened Amezo RL. There's a general rift between Ayashii Worlders and 2ch users.

Oct 2000 – Conflicts between 2ch and the Ayashii World reach their boiling point when both sites plan for mass raid campaigns. It is revealed at an AyashiiWorld@REMIX thread, 2ch Wipe Out (2ch抹殺), that 2ch users used Ayashii World uploaders without permission, stole Ayashii Memes and claimed them as their own and made threads about trolling Ayashii sites (Does this remind you of anything?), including "The First Experience of Ayashii World", an untouchable sanctuary amongst Ayashii Worlders. In retaliation they used a Phaser Script based on the Perlduke Script, in order to bring down 2ch. Hiroyuki, realizing how much he fucked up, appeared that the same thread and apologized. The raids and trolling slowly went down, but the animosity between Ayashii World and 2ch already turned into hate, and it was now taboo to speak about 2ch on Ayashii World sites. Currently, Ayashii Worlders and 2ch don't hate each other anymore, but a friendly rivalry still exists.

Oct 16 2000 – Hiroyuki appears at Ayashii World II, panic ensues, and Mr. AGSstar comes to speak to him. Betraying most Ayashii Worlders' expectations, AGS treats Hiroyuki with respect, disassociated himself from the incident and even told him how to restrict IP addresses, regarded as a coward's move by most of the userbase, since AGS badmouthed 2ch constantly.

April/May 2001 - Lowtax creates the ADTRW (Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse) board on Something Awful.

Aug, 30, 2001 – By this point, 2ch became exponentially popular in Japan, to the point where it began to achieve mainstream mention. Due to an unknown reason, 2ch is in danger of dying, so a backup forum is created, called Futaba or 2chan (two-leaves). Futaba creates a board called /b/, for random content. The site supports images and develops a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seed culture brought by the 2channelers.

2002 - ADTRW creates Raspberry Heaven, a DC++ file sharing hub dedicated to anime, named after the ending song of Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven is itself a spin-off of SADCHUB (The Something Awful Direct Connect Hub), the former was created to separate anime from the rest of SA's topics. The hub had an IRC, #rapsberryheaven, originally hosted at MircX and later Pyoko IRC. There, a 14 years old moot and several ADTRW members were regulars. Users of the IRC would discover Futaba, and for a while interact with the site. Interaction is cut short when a massive Korean raid makes Futaba block all non-Japanese users, and historical event that would never be lifted.

# 2003

3 March 2003 - The first English language channel is created: world2ch, made by RIR6, a 16 years old Japanese. At first, it supported text only. Its userbase consisted of a mix of Japanese and English users, the only time that this happens for any considerable amount of time. The English speakers there are members of ADTRW who are also familiar with Futaba and visit it for its quirks. Later, English users would convince the owner to make an imageboard. He makes two, officially becoming the first western imageboards.

2003 – The 2chan appreciation thread is created on ADTWR, becoming the gateway between the eastern Internet culture and western. World2ch is discovered and posted on said thread, gaining a steady influx of English speaking users.

September 29 - moot registers 4chan.net, just because it looked like 2chan.net (Futaba Channel). Originally, his only intention was to own an e-mail address with @4chan.net, but he quickly gets to thinking.

September 30: Moot announces 4chan.net in Something Awful's ADTRW forum. Thread is titled "4chan.net - English 2chan.net!"

October 1 - 4chan.net is founded by moot, intended to be used as an English version of 2chan, a Japanese imageboard created in 2001 out of an extremely popular Japanese BBS called 2channel. moot creates /b/ (Anime/Random) and makes a topic at Something Awful and world2ch about the website, which is received extremely well. moot holds a contest to decide what 4chan's logo should be. In three hours of creating the contest, around 50 banners are submitted, after which moot decides to simply make it so that it would cycle through the best banners randomly every time a page was loaded.

October 2 - 4chan's hosting company receives an e-mail complaining about "lolikon and guro posted in /b/, to which moot writes back that neither of the two is illegal. Later in the day, moot creates a second board, /h/ (Hentai). The email was sent by Shii/Menchi because the people of world2ch felt 4chan ripped them off and tried to raid the place. After some drama moot ended up befriending them. The rules page describes /b/ as a test board which will later become an anime board. moot describes /b/ in a news post as "a retard bin" that will eventually be deleted. Guess some things never change.

October 6 - moot creates four new imageboards: /c/ (Anime/Cute), /d/ (Hentai/Alternative), /w/ (Wallpapers/Anime), and /y/ (Yaoi), along with an oekaki BBS board. moot also fixes a retention bug that cause posts to be deleted too quickly and raised the maximum number of log entries for each board from 500 to 5000 (2000 for /b/).

October 9 - Two new imageboards are created: /g/ (Guro), to clean the nastiest imagery on /h/, and /s/ (Sexy Beautiful Women). moot announces that 4chan received over one million hits in the past six days and may be looking for sponsors to help pay the bills. /s/ is managed by Boco\_T and PotatoSan. Boco\_T also drew two of 4chan's title images: one of Osaka from Azumanga Daioh, and one of Cardcaptor Sakura drawn in the style of Fist of the North Star.

October 16 - 4chan is announced to 2chan, resulting in a massive amount of Japanese users coming to the site, at least doubling the traffic of all boards and decoupling the traffic of /c/. The onslaught of unexpected traffic causes /b/ to crash for two days. Killing it for the first time.

October 21 - 4chan.net is moved to United Colo, a collocation and webhosting company, following a discussion on the Something Awful forums.

October 29 – The site is back online. moot makes various changes to the imageboards, including Japanese character display and adding the day of the week to posts. He also announces that the boards will now use a MySQL database (a modified form of 2chan's futabaSQL called yotsubaSQL) and added a robots.txt file to the site to keep out some auto-downloaders, along with an .htaccess file to prevent hotlinking. /g/ temporarily suffered a problem with tripcodes, and all boards had a problem where users said their posts were not appearing and they were getting a Japanese error message. Both of these were fixed within the day by modifying the anti-spam script and fixing the imageboards' .php files, respectively.

November 1 - moot begs for donations in the first of a long history of times, complaining that the site is running extremely slowly and that he would have to block Japanese domains unless something was done, and that the cost of moot's server bill was now $400/month. moot warns that 4chan will die slowly unless enough donations are received.

November 2 - moot resets img.4chan.net and deletes all posts, drops all MySQL tables, and reduces the maximum post limit for each board from 3000 to 750. MySQLd and PHP were optimized and moot laments that he cannot implement auto-pruning after ten pages like 2chan.

November 8 - Two more imageboards are added: /a/ (Anime) and /l/ (Lolikon), because /c/ was flooded with NSFW images. moot announces the future release of a database of archived 4chan threads that requires a paid subscription, which had been suggested by Spork, a mod, a week before. By this time /b/ lost the anime/random subtitle and became just the random board.

November 10 - moot and his friend thatdog begin testing on the beta-archive and set up a new board, /r/ (Trains) to test it with. The same day, thatdog registers 1chan.net and sets up a similar train board on his site. /r/ quickly fills with /b/tards in order to help moot out.

November 20 **–** At some point, hosting switched from Colo to Apex, however Apex tells moot that 4chan has to go. 4chan dies for the second time. Hosting then passes to GoDaddy.

November 22 - The site returns following two days of downtime after the server is reformatted to RH9, making the site considerably faster. moot deletes /r/ (Trains) and announces that the thread archive will be up shortly. The next day, the RH9 apt-get repository was cleared out, causing GIFs not to be thumbnailed correctly for a few hours.

November 28 – moot announces downtime to fix some problems.

November 29 – Downtime cancelled. Staff member DJ Lucid managed to fix every single problem without needing to reformat the servers.

December 16 - A new board is created, /t/ (Torrents), along with a torrent tracker. moot tightens the rules regarding /h/ and /l/ and cracks down on rule breakers. moot also considers blocking Japanese domains due to the fact that they make up half of 4chan's traffic and post only extremely rarely.

December 17 - moot blocks all Japanese domains from accessing the site, significantly reducing 4chan's server bill while maintaining the same level of contribution. Apparently, moot says that in the two weeks before the announcement, Japanese domains had accounted for 650 GB but only made about fifty posts or so.

December 20 - 4chan changes its board software from modified GazouBBS (modified 2chan code) to Futallaby, created by 1chan's thatdog.

December 29 - Following a massive flood of real-life child pornography, /l/ (Lolikon) is temporarily deleted. moot announces that although he has blocked Japanese domains, his traffic from the rest of the world has now passed the rate from before December 17, meaning that moot's server bill is still $400/month.

# 2004

January 8 - /l/ (Lolikon) returns along with a new imageboard, /r/ (Request), which was created after many posts on /t/ were requests instead of links to torrents. Although at the beginning it was created for torrent requests, it quickly morphed into the /r/ we know and love today.

January 25 - Censored Vagina announces that the torrent tracker has been taken down due to it being a major strain on the server, along with the /t/ board. He also announces that the torrent tracker will return shortly, albeit it in a considerably smaller form, with a maximum of 40 torrents.

February 11 - Something Awful user "nubdestroyer" attempts to get 4chan shut down, this time by e-mailing GoDaddy, the owner of 4chan.net. He succeeds. 4chan moves to 4chan.org where it is today.

February 14 - After GoDaddy suspends the 4chan.net domain three days before without moot realizes, he registers 4chan.org as a temporary domain until everything is sorted out. Thus, 4chan died for the third time.

February 19 - /t/ (Torrents) returns, albeit without the tracker, along with a new board, /f/ (Flash). moot adds a new server, cgi.4chan.org, on which /f/ is hosted.

February 21 - Two discussion boards are added, hosted on 0ch: /amh/ (Anime-Manga-Hentai) and /bbs/ (4chan Discussion). The next day, Censored Vagina makes a newspost announcing that the cost of running 4chan for the rest of 2004 added up to $2,200 and that the money would be needed in donations. The links on 4chan are reflected to link to 4chan.org instead of 4chan.net so that users will not need to write 4chan.org's IP into their hosts file.

March 1 - moot announces that the site will not be able to continue because the March server bill is too large to pay and that more donations will be required to pay it or 4chan will die. He makes one final request for donations and hopes for the best. According to a news post image about the original /q/, /q/ - Questions was added this day.

March 8 - After a week-long swarm of donations, moot announces that not only does he have enough money to pay the March bill, but that enough money was donated to keep the site running into 2005. moot thanks all donators and posters and announces that he is currently in "Cancun, Mexico".

March 28 - The 4chan.org domain becomes permanent, with 4chan.net now occupied by domain squatters (people who buy domains that will get a lot of traffic, such as porn.com, and put ads on the page). moot tells users to inform all people linking to 4chan about this change so that the domain squatters receive as little traffic as possible and therefore not profit from the incident. He also deletes /g/ (Guro) around this time, possibly due to issues with PayPal.

April 1 - As an April Fools' Day prank, moot posts pictures of a man in a graduation uniform shortly after getting his diploma from Stanford University, and posts another picture of the man on April 4, this time showing him next to a statue in Mexico. moot claimed that the man in the photographs was him, and that his name was Robert Bopkins, and this was believed by most of 4chan for a long while until moot appeared in the flesh at the 2005 Otakon Panel, revealing himself to have a teenage-like un-nerdy appearance, which surprised many /b/tards.

April 4 - Spork (4chan mod) creates an official IRC channel for 4chan, hosted on irc.pyoko.org. The channel was later moved, hosted on irc.rizon.net, where it remains today.

April 19 - 100K GET on /b/ is reached. Many were creating new topics rapidly in hopes of getting the GET for themselves, but 100K GET turned out to be an unrelated text reply in a thread that attempted to have 100K GET. The reply was completely unrelated to the thread that it was in, only saying "lol internet" with no image. To this day, it is considered to be the most win that a GET has ever been.

April 30 - moot announces that the text boards are back up, running on board software created by Shii (4chan mod and friend of moot from SA). Two of these text boards were added that day as well: /dis/ (Discussion) and /sug/ (Suggestion) (now both deleted).

June 15 - TheRowan, owner of HentaiKey and host of 5chan, disappointed that his site was getting no traffic, attempts to get 4chan shut down. This time by e-mailing PayPal who controlled 4chan's donations at the time. He succeeds and cuts moot of all the donation money he had.

June 20 - A day that will live forever in short-term memory. 4chan dies for the fourth and longest time, for nearly six weeks. Moot, completely cut from donation money, can't afford to pay the +500$ dollars bill, so he shuts down the site. He blames it on lack of contribution and donations, asshole posters, and GNAA flooding, among other things, as the reasons for 4chan's death. Many 4channers flocked to the handful alternative chans that were funded, such as iichan and 5chan.

July 7 – iichan, idlechan, is founded. One of the first 4chan sister sites of the many to come, founded by Thock.

August 6 – Due to disagreements with the host, Zadabab shuts 5chan down.

August 7 - 4chan returns in its fifth incarnation following six weeks of downtime after gathering up enough money and support. Many new moderators and administrators are added as well, post by staff member are made under the name of "The Team"

August 15 - 4chan changes its board software to a "super-hacked" version of Futallaby coded mostly by W.T. Snacks. It contains many new features such as replying with an image, hiding posts, the Name and E-mail fields, displaying image names and sizes, and linking to other posts by adding a >> next to the post number. Tripcodes were also added to /f/.

August 16 - Saved thread reveals that the following boards existed already: "/m/", "/n/" (Trains), and "/cm/" (Cute Male) /cm/ was created to keep male content out of /c/. The discussion boards "/anime"/, "/ascii/" and "/game/" already existed. /r/ was named "/r/ - Request". Top of page boards list: a/b/c/d/f/g/h/l/m/n/p/r/s/t/u/w cm/y anime/ascii/dis/game/sug.

September 8 - Three new boards are added: /k/ (Weapons), /o/ (Auto), and /sm/ (Shota/Male). Jibaku (4chan mod) announces that /b/ is severely lacking in quality and asks users to contribute better.

September 17 – 5chan comes back from the dead.

October 1 – 4chan turns one year old.

October 9 - Four boards are added: /ib/ (Oekaki Random), /ip/ (Oekaki Pro), /v/ (Video Games), and /tech/ (Technology, discussion board); one board, /n/ (Trains) is deleted. Around this time, /z/ (ZOMG NONE!!1), a user-moderated board which utilizes the "Idiot King" model from SA's FYAD, where the userbase has to vote for its mods, is created. With flashing backgrounds, annoying embedded music, and legendary posts. Their first moderator was Soviet Russia !lM51PoudCg) .

October 23 – 5chan closes down permanently due a misunderstanding between TheRowen and Zadabab. moot celebrates.

October 24 – iichan, one of 4chan's first clone sites (Or rather, sister site, as it did not run on Futallaby but rather Kareha), dies due to lack of founding. Iichan grew big enough to sport its own memes and culture. Months later it's revived in the form of WAKAchan and adopted by Russians years later in iichan.ru. WAKAchan still exists to this day, and operates in a manner that there's no central hosting but rather various persons hosting different parts of the site.

October 30 - 4chan hosts a panel at the AnimeUSA 2004 Con in Vienna, Virginia. The same day, 4chan experiences DNS problems, and asks that people edit their host files once again.

October 31 - /l/ (Lolikon) and /ss/ (Shotakon) are deleted due to threats of legal action. On November 5, moot registers not4chan.org and moves /l/ and /ss/ there instead. On November 15, /g/ (Guro) is deleted as well due to threats from YowCow to seize 4chan's donations account due to guro being against YowCow's ToS.

November 1 - squeeks registers 4-ch.net, a site not related to 4chan's text boards. moot complains that squeeks is stealing his thunder. The site is based on 2channel rather than Futaba and is run on a heavily modified version of Kareha coded by !WAHa.06x36. Man of Wax (4chan mod) begs for donations and advertising on the front page of 4chan. /z/ was deleted shortly after this time.

December 24 – moot adds the world4ch BBS, named in honour to the by then defunct world2ch, modeled after 2ch and based on Shii's board code.

# 2005

January 6 – Cracky-chan saga - The first picture of a strangely artistic teenager appears on /b/. Anonymous becomes infatuated with the girl and scours the Internet for her pictures. A tripfag under the name of cracky-chan!N1toQkxgzc starts posting.

January 13 - 4chan's IRC channel moves from irc.pyoko.org to irc.rizon.net. This is announced on the front page, along with one of the first lines ever spoken in 4chan's Rizon channel: <moot> _i wish to be the little girl._

January 19 - Four new boards are added: /e/ (Ecchi), /3/ (3DCG, stands for 3-D Computer Graphics), /g/ (Technology), and /n/ (Nature & Wildlife). /g/ and /n/ are worksafe.

January 27 - Three more boards are added: /ic/ (Artwork/Critique), /p/ (Photography), and /x/ (General Photo). Although there was already a /p/ board for photography before, it is the replacement, with new features (such as EXIF data), /x/ takes a general photography board, where all photography goes, and /p/ becomes specifically about pictures taken by users or artists.

February 3 - moot and shut register _ikuzo.org_, a side project they had formulated during 4chan's downtime in summer 2004. The site was basically meant to be a weeaboo site with news and reviews of things like anime, hentai, and general Japanese imports. However, the project is quickly abandoned and the site now redirects to img.4chan.org.

February 5 – The Cracky-chan obsession becomes so big W. T. Snacks wordfiltered her name with similarly sounding names (Creaky-chan, fappy-chan, etc). Many stalkers created fansites.

February 13 - 700K GET is fixed by the mods, with the word "ZERO HOUR" written in extremely large letters and the post count reset to 1, and the message, "ONLY 699999 TO GO GUYS!!". However, the post count is restored within the day.

February 14 – On view of the 700K GET, moot changes /b/'s layout to a dark pink and renames the board to "/b/ - Dick GET", "Dick" being the .gif of a rotating penis. moot stickies a thread claiming its Valentine 's Day and also stickies the 700001 post.

February 25 – moot organizes an IRC townhall and stickied a thread of a naked dude posted by a tripfag. The IRC is flooded by thousands and fails horribly.

February 26 - Following the townhall, moot creates three more boards: /gif/ (Animated GIF), /hr/ (High Resolution), /wg/ (Wallpapers/General), and removes /x/.

March 29 – A Livejournal from Cracky, freakygirl, is found. The owner of a Cracky-chan website, Creacky-chan.com claims it's fake, though it may have been a move to protect her identity. Another Livejournal, kittykat soon gets found, whether fake or real.

March 31 - moot purchases a new server (tmp.4chan.org, backup of orz.4chan.org) and announces that it will be up in April. He also announces that 4chan will have a panel at Otakon 2005 and announces that he would soon recruit a new administrator following DJ Lucid's (4chan admin) departure.

April 1 – Aprils Fur's Day - For April Fools' Day, moot makes a front-page newspost containing a picture of Robert Bopkins (thought to be moot at the time) in graduation gear shortly after graduating from Stanford University, along with the message "GREETINGS FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL!". moot also creates a new board, /fur/ (Furry), despite his promise never to do so. Although many think it the board is simply an April Fools' Day joke, the board remained the next day and began to be taken seriously. However, on the morning of April 3rd, everyone who had posted in /fur/ was banned for three months (including /b/tards who posted on /fur/ to denounce furries), following which 4chan was almost rid of furfags. This event has remained embedded in the mind of every furry in hopes of moot ever making a new, permanent version of /fur/.

April 3 – Shii cracks Cracky-chan's tripcode. Since the password was "sweet", the theory of a fake tripfag gains solidity.

April 6 – Another of Cracky-chan's Livejournal get known under the name of "scarecrownmaiden". It contained many more artsy pictures, even nudes. The journal gets deleted quickly by the owner.

April 7 - 1M GET is reached on /b/. It was considered an "alright" GET, neither fail nor win. 1M GET was posted by a namefag under the handle Senator Rodden Clitoris, who posted picture of Sae Sawanoguchi from Magic Users Club having an orgasm with the Female Orgasm copypasta, which was deleted within a few seconds. The mods instead chose another thread with a picture of a budgie in a jar and changed its posted number to 1000000 and stickied it, fooling many into believing that it was the true 1M GET.

June 5 - /b/ gets renamed to /b/ - Marked For Deletion (/b/). An enormous thread with screencaps of epic threads gets stickied.

June 6 – Cracky-chan pics become a bannable offense, according to W. T. Snacks, per alleged request of Cracky-chan herself.

July - /b/tard Warchief Rend Niggerhand opens Crackypedia, a place with all storts of stalkerish information about Cracky

July 1 - Many of 4chan's boards were closed unexpectedly and announcement was supposedly made by "moot's secretary", later known to be staff member Majnem was posted on the front page, announcing that moot had abandoned 4chan and that 4chan would cease operations in a few days due to lack of funding. The next day, moot made a newspost announcing that that this had all happened behind his back, and that the post was neither true nor official.

July 29 - /b/ reaches 2M GET, a picture of someone holding up a notepad with "2000000 GET?" written on it, and the text "HAY GUYS! 2MIL GET! -Delcious Ironing" [sic]. This was (badly) photoshopped with a smiling ugly man and the text, "HAY GUYEZ WOULD YOU BE UP FOR SOME ADULT FUN AT MY COUNTRY CLUB SOMETIME -Delcious ron", which spawned a whole series of shopped GETs.

August 12 – Saturgay, /b/ gets spammed with images of Seizure 5, Hard Gay and Sageman

August 13 - Shortly after celebrating one year of uptime, 4chan starts its panel at Otakon 2005, the first time ever that /b/tards actually met the real moot, after which he revealed that "Robert Bopkins" was not only not him, but that Bopkins' name was actually Eric J. Ross and moot picked the photos at random. Everyone has a really good time and moot hangs out with /b/tards who flip out over the fact that they are experiencing mootfaggotry IRL.

August 28 - Donate or Die 2005 - moot announces that he requires $20,000 in donations to purchase three new servers (bin.4chan.org, nov.4chan.org, and a second img.4chan.org). Frenzy started, with camwhores showing their tits and vagoo if users donated to 4chan. Within a week, $14,000 was raised, which was actually enough to purchase the three servers, although they fell short of their goal. Later, on September 15th, moot announces that donations will cease September 30th, and even then can only be delivered by snail mail.

October 1 - 4chan turns two years old. Dan makes a commemorative picture.

October 16 - 3M GET on /b/, with a picture of Waha and Pedobear and how they would be seen in America. The post linked to itself, prefixed by ">>3000000" and "TIME PARADOX/what a lame GET/Surely you jest!". It was, unfortunately, a tripfag get, posted by 4chan mod Pixel Hotness !Ol2RiO/0Ro. The GET was considered "meh" for being a modGET.

October 25 - moot announces that "things are looking up" and announces that many new features will be added to 4chan, including the DevBlog. He also begs for people to advertise because he needs money to construct additional pylons.

October 30 - moot and Snacks have a long fight over IRC as moot takes the site down for a few hours to fix some problems. moot rages against Snacks for being a lazy coder and threatens to take away his server access, and generally being very arrogant towards Snacks. They both go to sleep, and continue in the afternoon the next day for about three hours, until moot tells Snacks that he will remove his server access (along with his moderator powers), which he does shortly afterwards, making him unable to moderate or code. Snacks then "leaves" 4chan for good.

November 2 - moot challenges Xenon, a popular flash artist camwhore whose artwork is often spammed on /f/, to a camwhore battle, which moot loses. moot then tells Xenon that since he beat him, Xenon received temporary admin status and moot declared November 2 to be "the Day of Xenon". Xenon used his new privileges to change /b/'s CSS layout, resulting in /b/'s background becoming pink and the Powerpuff Girls theme song being embedded into every page. /b/'s title was also changed to "All Hail Xenon".

November 3 - moot, liking the idea of fucking around with /b/'s layout, changes /b/'s background to a seizure-inducing GIF flashing yellow and white, with the techno-country song "Cotton-Eye Joe" by Rednex embedded into the pages. /b/'s title was then changed to "ON A STEEL HORSE I RIDE", and a sticky was created in which the new layout could be discussed.

November 4 - Shortly after midnight, /b/'s layout was changed again to a pink McDonald's-themed background, with "moving JavaScript Golden Arches" as Lurkmore put it, along with a 1980s McDonald's jingle added as background music. This hack lasted for three days and was hated by almost everybody. During this time, Xenon released the chatlogs from moot and Snacks' fight, causing massive outrage on /b/.

December 19 - moot posts a thread in /v/ asking for applications to be a janitor (person who can delete posts but not ban), which was up to that point unheard of. News of this spread to /b/, and many applications were received, and the janitors were implemented within the month.

# 2006

January 30 - moot implements forced anonymous on /b/, with users unable to post with a name, tripcode, or subject, remaining until March 26, 2007, which, by then, it had definitely worn out its welcome.

February 6 - orz.4chan.org and cgi.4chan.org crash and are not fixed until three days later. During this time, the secret board, /5/, hosted on the orz server, was deleted.

February 12 – Cracky-chan discovers her cult and decides it's enough. She makes a public statement on 420chan telling everyone to stop. Later, Kirtaner closes the board.

February 17 - The three new servers purchased during the Donate or Die 2005 campaign are successfully brought online. Each served as a backup for three of 4chan's content servers, with nov.4chan.org backing up cgi, bin.4chan.org backing up zip, and tmp.4chan.org backing up orz (img was already backed up by dat.4chan.org). In addition, the new servers took care of all post submissions, speeding up the boards significantly.

February 18 - The day after the new servers are installed, 5M GET is achieved, during which the posting rate increased twenty fold. The servers were put to the test, with jumbo.4chan.org maxing out its line at 99.31 Mbit/s (~12.41 megabytes per second). The 5M GET was a picture of cat taken at an angle that made the cat look large, with the text "Needs more towercat". Users were divided between whether it was win or fail, although moot himself called it "more garbage" in the DevBlog.

March 23 - 6M GET was achieved on /b/, with a picture of Senator Bill Frist holding up a card and the text "In after 6M GET". It was mostly considered a winGET due to the potential for epic shoops.

April 1 - /b/'s CSS is fucked with yet again, with the page layout being changed to tanasinn.org's layout, with a looping voice saying "Don't think. Feel and you'll be Tanasinn." Letters were randomly changed to the three-dot triangle symbol.

April 4 – moot makes a joke – BAD END. moot was eaten by a shark. ~fin~

April 6 - Three new trial boards are added: /co/ (Comics & Cartoons), /po/ (Papercraft & Origami), and /sp/ (Sports). Two days later, five more boards are added: /cgl/ (Cosplay & EGL), /ck/ (Food & Cooking), /mu/ (Music), /n/ (News) (Changing /n/ - Animals & Nature to /an/), and /tv/ (Television).

April 10 – When a user shows his ban reason as being DSFARGEG, he is banned and his thread stickied. Later seven threads are stickied, are stickied along with another DSFARGEG post, which consisted on a puppet from a Japanese show riding a motorcycle.

April 11 – /b/tards start to spam /b/ with the same puppet. Every post gets stickied and banned. This concluded with entire pages consisting only of stickied bans. DSFARGEG would be banned on sight from them on.

April 14 - moot announces that the three servers purchased during Donate or Die 2005 have been collocated and are up and running and also announces that he will rarely use the front page for small updates from now on, instead choosing to announce them on the DevBlog and blotter. moot also announces that 4chan will have a panel at which he will appear at AnimeCentral 2006, which took place on May 4. The next day, moot removes most of the wordfilters on /b/ and implements new ones.

April – Many of the original wordfilters are removed and new ones are implemented.

April 20 - 7M GET is reached, but due to the high strain on the server, the file was deleted, and the post had no text. However, mods retrieved the MD5 data from the picture from their database and found that it was the popular image macro of Chopper Dave from Sealab 2021 shouting "UH OHHHHHHH". In the same day, /b/ discovers that 13-year-old Mitchell Henderson kills himself over an iPod, after which /b/ raids his memorial MySpace and the "an hero" meme is born after a classmate of his posted a poem she written on his memorial account in which she constantly referred to him as "an hero".

May 11 - Eight threads are stickied, all consisting of modified versions of a picture from some Japanese show with a puppet riding on a motorcycle and the text "DSFARGEG". All posts were followed by (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST) and DSFARGEG almost always resulted in a ban or a sticky.

May 18 - /b/ reaches 8M GET, one of the first GETs to be auto-stickied. It was considered a WinGET, due to the fact that it was a picture of George Zimmer and the text "HI, I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF MEN'S WAREHOUSE. THIS IS 8000000 GET. I GUARANTEE IT".

June 15 - Comedian Tom Green starts his own late-night call-in talk show hosted from his own living room, hosted every night at 11 PM EST. Over the next three months, /b/ trolls his show, with around 10% of all calls on the show being prank calls from 4chan. /b/ also focused on a section of his show, "Girl Talk", which featured five stereotypical "dumb chicks" giving advice on relationships. The trolling of Girl Talk was so intense that it was canceled on August 19th because of it, combined with bad response from viewers. It would eventually become a tradition to raid Tom Green whenever he went.

June 17 - A group of anons crapflood the Zelda Guide Forums for fun, after which a member threatens to "hack" 4chan. This prompts their leader, known as "Captain Cornflake" (the name of his raid account on Zelda Guide Forums, he was anonymous on /b/) to post this information to /b/. Many Anonymous joined the raid following this post and crapflooded the forums nearly into oblivion during the night while the moderating team was asleep. As the moderators were surveying the carnage the next morning, one mod actually pleaded for /b/ to stop and said he would give them their own board to spam, which just increased the raid. The forums now require manual admin verification, which keeps out many legit users, resulting in an anon victory.

June 19 - Yet another epic raid occurs, with /b/ destroying naruto-kun.com after a user there posted about their dislike of 4chan. Following a major porn flood after which the site admin threatened to sic the FCC on 4chan, one anon discovered a source code document hidden on the site containing the site's SQL database password (which Anon posted on /b/) as well as loads of unchecked MySQL injection vulnerabilities. Anonymous also discovered that the fucking dumbass's FTP had the same password as his MySQL database, following which tons of anons logged in to the FTP account and deleted everything, destroying the entire site, including premium accounts and the database, and bringing the site down for two days.

July 4 - The first of many in a series of /b/ CSS hacks in July as the background was turned red and the text yellow. July 10th saw the theme song from "Bill Nye the Science Guy" embedded into the background (no layout changes however), while July 15th harbored a sticky in which "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by composer Richard Strauss (2001: A Space Odyssey theme song) was embedded. Toward the end of July, ten threads were stickied, taking up the entire first page of /b/, and the theme song from Inspector Gadget was embedded into /b/.

July 6 – Crackypedia closes per (alleged again) Cracky-chan's request. The owner posts a macro with the date of closure, viewcount (17464) and the message "Hope you enjoyed it folks, I told you it wouldn't last forever."

July 7 - 10M GET is reached, considered the most failed GET of all time, simply a picture of Hazuki from the anime Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase- on a merry-go-round, with the text "hazukiget". Ironically, it was much later revealed to be a modGET, but with no trickery involved; Shii (4chan admin; coder of discussion boards) got the GET out of pure luck, proving that all modGETs, staged or not, will always be fail.

July 8 - 4chan returns after nearly a day of downtime. There has not been any honest answer in regards to the cause, some claim it was due to 4chan's bandwidth provider, Cogent, and the image flood to reach the 10000000 GET; to reports of the FBI seizing the hardware in search of CP.

July 12 – The great Habbo raid of July 2006 - 4chan (along with Encyclopedia Dramatica, YTMND, GNAA, Bantown, and myg0t) storm Habbo Hotel. A virtual online role playing game where, among other things, people pay real-life money for online money. Thousands of "nigras" (black characters with afros wearing business suits, the official raid costume) filled nearly every room on the site, especially the Pool Deck, during which the pool was blocked for hours because the pool had AIDS. The sheer number of Anonymous was so great that the Habbo mods could not ban the nigras faster than the accounts were being created, resulting in the mods having no choice but to reset their server, after which the raid continued for a few more hours on Habbo servers in other countries, particularly the German Habbo Hotel (where the nigras would form in swastika patterns). The Habbo raid is often considered /b/'s best and spawned the "Nigra" meme and the "Pool's closed" meme. The word "AIDS" was later wordfiltered on Habbo as a result of the raid.

July 16 - Moderators make a sticky of a girl known as Ban-Chan, knowing full well that it is CP. Later that day, in a hypocritical statement, moderators inform 4chan that there will be less tolerance for posting illegal things.

July 20 - moot announces that they will have a panel at Otakon 2006 from August 4-6 in Baltimore, Maryland, with enough seating capacity to allow 680 people compared to the 230 from Otakon 2005.

July 22 - /v/ reaches 1M GET, considered to be one of the greatest non-/b/ gets of all time. The GET was a picture of PONG, the first-ever video game, thus a very fitting get for /v/. A small group of users believe that the GET was staged, citing an overload of Final Fantasy VII pics as the reason.

August 4 - Otakon 2006 starts and so does 4chan's panel. Many important 4channers are there, including moot, shut, Shii, and the apparent return of W.T. Snacks. An epic sermon was delivered by "Reverend" Lemmy Caution to spread the gospel of Raptor Jesus, and moot even created a new board, /con/ (Conventions), for people at the con to use, which was deleted a few hours after the con ended.

August 12 - The 4chan :codes: (words put between colons that are turned into smilies, like how posting :happy: would display a happy emoticon, for example) are released to the site. They are soon spammed all over the place, and threads are pruned extremely quickly. Images and .gifs of "eng101", "w00t", "SAGE" (the classic blue Sega image edited to spell sage), "owned", "iceburn", the classic flashing "5", the green 4chan "cone", "sweatdrop", and "Hard Gay" were posted in large amount, often causing threads to be derailed in seconds.

August 16 – The Tom Green raids - Tom Green, an Canadian host in an Internet call in show, Tom Green's House Tonight, gets massively prank called by /b/tards, who made him hold a paper with the work b written on, wear a wig, suffered an hour long of DESU spam and meme spouting such as "Do a barrel roll". All these calls ended up clogging the lines and keeping actual fans from calling in. Green gets pissed enough that he announces on live TV: "thanks to you assholes this will no longer be a call in show". The next show in line was GirlTalk, which also got raided by /b/. This raid is possible because neither shows screened their calls.

August 22 - A group of Anonymous go on a midnight raiding spree, eventually attracting tons (~100) of Anonymous to their posse in raid threads. They charged, destroying Proana.us (a pro-anorexia community), deleting all accounts on the site. After this (by now around 1:00 AM of August 23), they attempted to raid the myg0t forum, but the raid failed due to myg0t's massive size. Instead, they raided teenbabynet.org (not only furries, but teenage furries with diaper fetishes), locking the forum and rendering it totally unviewable by 10:00 AM. At around this time, they turned their attention to WikiFur, leaving it in complete disarray. With mods extremely worried, moot does something drastic around noon of August 23...

August 23 – The /b/-day - moot (in a somewhat justifiable fit of anger) posts a sticky announcing that anyone who posts illegal content will get you permabanned and possibly arrested, and that even people who REPLY to illegal threads will receive a two-week global ban, with the definition of "illegal threads" referring to CP, jailbait, personal info, and raids (some of /b/'s most cherished traditions). This led to a massive outcry due to the fact that this policy was technically introducing rules to /b/, whose main goal was to be a rule-free board. CP/Jailbait is posted in defiance, mass "WTF IS THIS SHIT" spamming and Hitler references. There was a sudden universal reset. /b/ had no posts, and the sticky was gone. It was soon replaced with a new sticky restating the policy in a softer manner, only to be re-stickied and a new thread with the original text with added information stickied, which was then de-stickied and re-stickied over and over by moot and other mods that disagreed with him. This along spamming from angry /b/tards, caused img.4chan.org to crash, leaving 14 boards, including /b/, /an/, /b/, /c/, /cm/, /g/, /k/, /m/, /o/, /p/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /v/, and /w/ inaccessible. A civil war broke out, with many /b/tards permanently leaving 4chan and taking up new homes at 7chan, AnonIB, IIChan, 2ch.ru (Which would go on to fund the entirety of the Russian chanverse), and 420chan. moot got rid of the policy very shortly afterwards due to the enormous backlash. However, img.4chan.org didn't return until August 25, two days later. Eventually, it would be considered that the events of the /b/-day where a failure, because a week later /b/ was doing the same routine as if it never happened. On the rest of the Internet, however, this resulted in a massive increase of alternative image boards, like WTFux, 7chan, 2ch.ru and others where many banned users took an exodus to. This marked the rise of the /i/nsurgence, given that 7chan and AnonIB housed an /i/ board, long forbidden by moot, for the first time the /b/tard would orchestrate raids on an organized fashion.

August 25 - /b/ is restored with img.4chan.org, inciting floods by opponents of the mod's new policies. Later this day  [www.anonib.com/invasions/](http://www.anonib.com/invasions/) is flooded (presumably) by 4channers with desu and images of Suiseiseki, leading to the board crashing and all of the content being deleted. Debates and flamewars sparked across /b/ between both opposing sides. In addition, /b/ in general had been divided into two factions of /b/tards with the original /b/ claiming the majority. Many /b/tards trolled both sides and managed to spark a few debates over which board was better. One side saying the other had gotten boring while the other side claiming the others weren't real /b/tards. Eventually the threads burned themselves out and the people went to bed.

August 26 - Despite all the internet drama; 4chan /b/ is online and back to running as normal. Floods by those angry with the more vigilant enforcement of long-standing rules against illegal content have mostly subsided. The only remaining conflicts have led to meme wars and a competitive "Who's better than who?" flood war. However, the rage slowly calmed and the major populace of both 7chan and 4chan grew tired of it. What was left were threads developed with the hopes of cultivating peace, harmony, and friendship, but ultimately things ended in bitter separation.

September 4 - World-famous Australian "croc hunter" Steve Irwin is killed by a stingray barb to the heart while filming a documentary. /b/ is immediately flooded with this information and one of the first threads to announce it was stickied for a week, becoming the most replied-to thread in /b/ history with slightly over 5,200 replies (later beaten by the "#fortune" sticky on April 27, 2007). Many Rule 34s and general parodies are posted in /b/ during that time.

September 11 – Habbo, Revisited - In response to Steve Irwin's death, the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and hatred for Habbo Hotel, /b/, led by AFRODUCK, starts another massive raid on Habbo, with around 5,000 Anonymous partaking in the raid (~600 nigras on the Pool Deck alone). They blocked every single room, announcing that not only did the pool have AIDS, but also had stingrays as well. The raid continued for entire days until September 14.

October (May have happened as early as January) – After a new wave of janitors is recruited, moot adds /j/, the secret staff board, back then known as /j/ - Janitor (Nowadays named Janitor & Moderator Discussion). The first thread is moot ordering all janitors to report there, failure to comply after a week resulting in loss of privileges/ban.

October 1 - /b/ celebrates its third anniversary, and places blue-and-pink striped party hats on the top of each thread. /b/tards made pictures interacting with the hats, causing many threads that are epic win (a good chunk of epic thread screencaps are from this day). Dan makes a second commemoration.

October 20 - Jake Brahm turns himself in to authorities following a now-infamous copypasta that he had written, reposting it around 40 times within the previous 30 days, in which he warned of simultaneous terrorist attacks against seven football stadiums across the United States on October 22nd. Two days before this, on October 18, the Department of Homeland Security was notified about the copypasta and attempted to track down and arrest the creator of it; when the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin police department (Brahm's town of residence) received a tip on October 20, he turned himself in and faces up to 20 years imprisonment, thus making him the only person to have been party v& for his actions as of 2007. The phrase "DON'T MESS WITH FOOTBALL", uttered by FBI agent Les Wiser during a news report on Brahm's arrest, has since become a meme.

October 30 – Habbo, Revisited 2 or the Habbo fail raid – Somewhere around 100 nigras gather around Habbo Hotel, but are banned quickly.

November 7 - After moot doesn't pay the bills, the site goes down for two days, during which a page was put up explaining that the servers were gone because moot didn't pay and that the problem would be fixed within "24-48 hours" (crossed out with "FIFTY-BILLION YEARS" written next to it). Many /b/tards, looking for a temporary \*chan to go to until 4chan returns, cause a major spike in traffic for other \*chans as /b/tards go there temporarily. 7chan and 12chan were destroyed by the flood of traffic and suffered severe downtime.

November 21 - /b/space day – A /b/tard loads a keyloggers on a public PC and gives /b/ over 40000 MySpace accounts and passwords. Of course, they proceed to have a field day over it.

November 30 - moot announces that more banner ads from AdBrite will be added to 4chan in December due to the fact that donations are no longer possible. As a result of the extra money, 4chan becomes faster after moot uses the money for extra bandwidth capacity.

December 8 - Only 19 days after /b/'s 16 millionth post, /b/ reached the 17 million mark late December 8th. This marks the shortest time it has ever taken to get another 1 million posts in all of /b/ and 4chan's history. Of course, in the following years, getting 1 million posts in a day would become something trivial.

December 20 - Hal Turner, a white supremacist talk show host from New Jersey, plans his final radio show due to lack of funding, in which he takes calls for three hours straight. However, a combined surprise raid from 4chan, 7chan, YTMND, Something Awful, and Bantown destroyed Hal's show, with 150 prank calls being made in three hours, with almost none of his real listeners being able to call in due to clogged lines. Hal then posts the phone numbers of the callers on his website (some of which were minors), sparking a huge outrage among /b/. Bantown then uncovered his personal information, including his real phone number, after which ~160 calls were made to his house. Hal gave in and removed the phone numbers from his site, but as we all know, Anonymous does not forgive.

December 24 - Taking /b/ by surprise on the eve of Christmas, Anonymous posts a story no truer than that of the wildest fantasies of /b/tards and surprisingly, admits it's wrong. What's even more amazing is that Anonymous sympathizes with Anonymous. This day is the birth and story of  [/b/man: A Christmas in the life of Anonymous](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/-b-man%3A-A-Christmas-in-the-life-of-Anonymous).

December 25 - Hal Turner spends Christmas with his family over at his father's house; news of this spread, and Bantown quickly found his father's number, leading to a massive amount of calls and Hal supposedly being kicked out of the house. After this, Hal claimed that the FBI was investigating 4chan (an Anonymous later called in to Hal's show claiming that he had contacted the FBI and that they had said that no such investigation was taking place) and redirected his website to the FBI page.

December 31 - A happy ending for 2006 after Hal Turner surrenders to 4chan after much raiding and lulz, and announces that he is almost off of the internet completely. He announces, "I am not certain where to go from here. My entire existence - short of my physical presence on this planet - has been utterly wrecked, by people I never met from places I've never been." Anonymous knocks back a cold one and lols heartily.

# 2007

January 3 – Hal Turner's third radio show gets dropped midsession allegedly because a hacker called Slogh held a grudge against him, and launched a botnet to DDOS the site.

January 5 – Hal Turner redirects his website to the FBI for a while in an effort to deter trolls.

January 9 - moot posts on the front page, announcing that 4chan would soon have interstitial ads due to dwindling revenue. moot also allows all of the trial boards created on April 6, 2006 to become full boards, except for /sp/ (Sports), which is deleted.

January 10 - All text disappears on /b/, with users only being able to talk through pictures or the E-mail field. Needless to say, this was win, and caused /b/ to be fag-free for a few hours.

January 22 – Hal Turners has enough and deletes his site.

January 24 – Ian, owner of 7chan, gets a notice from his host saying that the board /i/ violates the TOS. He deletes it. Meanwhile, Hal Turner gets kicked from his datacenter, and on the way to get a new way crashes his car.

January 27 – The great chan death of January 2007 - 4chan has a power failure and dies in the usual manner, however, so do all the other mayor imageboards of the Internet. 420chan was kicked out of from hosting, 12 was suspended by the FBI, 2ch.ru died for unknown reasons, and 7chan couldn't handle the influx of all the users bases put together and crashed. Even wikichan went down, to never return.

February 1 – Hal surrenders and claims to quit the internet. However that statement got the New York Times and a couple of watchers interested so he had more money for funding-.

February 3 - 20milGET is achieved, 16 days after 19milGET.

February 10 – Hal Turner redirects his own site to 420chan.org and claims the "Canadian Communist" Kirtaner hacked him. However a WHOIS search showed the truth.

February 12 – He gets his page back

February 15 - Two new boards are added: /tg/ (Traditional Games) and /x/ (Paranormal), the latter being created due to the popularity of 7chan's /x/ board and a rising creepypasta culture on /b/. moot also announces the winners in a contest for new banners. The next day, janitor applications are opened and then closed four days later, with the new janitors being implemented around early March.

March 7 – Hal makes another radio show, anonymous raids him again. He dedicated the show about the 21/4 raid.

March 21 - Anonymous discovers photos of 16-year-old Kelly Isenhower of Georgia sucking off her dog, as well as her phone number and address. Needless to say, Anon went batshit, raiding her DeviantArt and MySpace, calling her parents and telling them about the incident, and even e-mailing the photographs to her school principal, although she was adamant that the photos were shopped (which they obviously weren't). She was suspended from school indefinitely, her dog was taken away, and everyone now hates her, including all her former friends and her parents. Anonymous rejoices.

March 26 – The Great re/b/oot - moot announces a re/b/oot and aims to restore /b/ to its former glory. Two stickies are created, one being a letter moot received that inspired him to start the re/b/oot, and another sticky being his formal apology for "letting /b/ turn to shit". /b/'s background changed to a seizure-inducing flashing yellow and white background and a swf. file with the song "Cotton-Eyed Joe" embedded in the background. The Name and Subject fields return to /b/, effectively ending forced anonymous and allowing tripcodes. Many people were banned by moot in both stickies for comments such as "/b/ sucks", and in many other threads as well. Later, a third sticky was made which was a locked thread with only two posts, with the OP announcing that he was "afraid of being banned by the crazy bitch-ass mods" and also said, "You might as well make rules for /b/ now faggots", followed by which the poster was banned. Later in the day, 23M GET was achieved, which was a picture of a Pokemon with text InfernalRape and the past consisted of INFERNALGET. Considering this to be an extreme failGET (as did all of /b/), moot banned the poster, instantly transforming it into a winGET. The post timer is increased to a whopping 10 minutes and the post count reset several times.

March 27 – Transmission - The next day, /b/'s title changes to "Transmission" with Trans italicized and the background turned /b/lack, and techno music was played, specifically "You could easily have me" by Motronomy. A sticky was posted containing a picture of Diglet and said, "/b/ is /b/ again". Many users were banned in the thread for suggesting otherwise.

March 28 – Revolution - /b/'s title changed to "Revolution" and the background was changed yet again to gray with red tripcodes (allowing users to impersonate moot every easily), techno music was added with the prominent line, "I am the creator". A sticky was posted in which a user was banned for posting DSFARGEG.

March 29 – Showdown - The day after that, the title was Showdown and the background was changed to a rapidly flashing rainbow background, as well as the posts. A techno version of the song "Eye of the Tiger" with elements from "Let Your Backbone Slide", called "Tiger Said Knock You Out" by Neon Kobra, was added as background music. Four stickies were created, each with a GIF of a rainbow-flashing number 5 and the four stickies contained one line each of the song's opening verse (This is a showdown/A throwdown/Hell no, I can't slow down/It's gonna go).

March 30 – Intermission - The next day, /b/ returned to normal, with a normal layout and no background music, during which /b/'s title was changed to "Intermission".

April 1 - Following two days of normal /b/, techno music was again added as background music, but the CSS remained unchanged, signaling the end of the re/b/oot.

April 20 - 4chan administrators are forced to temporarily shut down img.4chan.org after a thread containing four uncensored images of child pornography became stuck on the front page for over an hour (during which nobody could post) and could not be deleted due to MySQL problems. Rather than getting v&, the plug was pulled on img.4chan.org and was restored around 12-15 hours later. During the downtime, since 7chan was down as well, a massive amount of /b/tards flocked to 420chan, thus ruining 420chan's most special day, 4/20.

April 21 – Hal Turner fail IRL raid – Hal Turned hyped the shit out of a supposed IRL raid, called two cop units, and ambulance and various friends. Only four channers, two anons and two girls (Or traps?) came in.

April 27 - "Fortunes" are introduced to /b/, a feature that moot had implemented from the very beginning but had never told anyone about. Basically, if you put your name as "#fortune", you will get a random fortune at the top of your post, chosen at random. moot announced it to the public after another mod told him to reveal it, causing mass spamming of fortunes. A thread in which someone guessed their own fortune was stickied and became the most replied-to thread in /b/ history, beating the Steve Irwin thread in just 19 hours with 5,336 posts.

April 28 – Subeta raids - 4chan, 7chan, and especially 420chan combine forces to attack Subeta, a faggot role-playing website similar to Gaia who stole Longcat and turned him into an item for their faggoty site. When the chans complained, Subeta DDoSed 420chan, leaving it in ruins and sticking Kirtaner (420chan's owner) with a $6,000 server bill. The \*chans then DDoS Subeta, which they find hard to do due to lack of effort, as well as Subeta's 2000 GB monthly bandwidth and lack of large images. Nevertheless, two major Subeta fansites were shut down permanently and Subeta was down for two days. Keith (Subeta's owner) eventually apologized and removed Longcat from his site after a long and bloody battle, at which many Anonymous rejoiced. On this same day, Encyclopedia Dramatica, one of /b/'s most famous recruiting posts, encountered a severe hard disk failure and does not return until June 8.

May - first known instance of a Rickroll in 4chan's /v/. Related to Grand Theft Auto.

May 13 - moot changes /b/'s layout so that everything is the same color (excluding checkboxes and fortunes), meaning that users will have to press Ctrl+A (Select All) or disable CSS in order to view text. A sticky is posted in which moot explains that the color change is to keep stupid people out, which moot closed a few hours later at around 1,900 posts. moot also announced that threads would go back to the limit of 250 posts and 100 images instead of 1000 posts and 500 images, so that topics can be pruned easier and that the directory dumper would be harder to abuse. The color change lasted a week (during which posting rates decreased by 10%) after which it was disabled, triggering some anger from some /b/tards who wished that the cancer could have been kept out longer.

June 5 - /co/ reaches 1M GET; the thread disappears within five seconds or so, and due to the strain on the server, the file was deleted as soon as it was uploaded. The post also had the text, "reducto get", referring to Reducto from Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, meaning that the picture was most likely one of him. The next day, /b/ reaches 29M GET, which the original poster deletes after three hours after being persuaded to do so in another thread.

July 12 – The Great Habbo Raid of July 2007 – Commemorating one year of the most epic raid ever done, /b/ sets out to raid Habbo hotel once again. This time, the mods decide that "If you can't beat them, join then" via declaring international Afro day. However this resulted in racist implications. There were many complains about the raid, mainly coming from lack of organization, but everyone agrees it was just as funny as the last year. At the same time, Tom Green makes a midnight show, completely drunk, and gets one single prank call from the anons. He spends the rest of the show shouting BARREL ROLL and MUDLIFFS at every caller, ended up closing the show half an hour earlier.

June 16 - 30M GET is achieved one hour after midnight, when many /b/tards are asleep. It was an extreme failGET, as was 10M GET and 20M GET. Consisting of the text "Shit. Getting closer" and a picture from some anime, it received around 2400 replies before being deleted 15 hours later.

July 17 – Anonymous raids potterforums.com via spam bots with the spoilers for Harry Potter's seventh book. They manage to close the site down

June 18 - moot brings back forced Anonymous on /b/ after someone insults him. Many think it is merely a temporary change, and they were right. The forced Anonymous remains in place for just over a month.

July 20 - Sometime around 5:40 P.M. EDT, forced anonymous is turned off again. No reason is given at the time, nor is a sticky posted. It is later revealed that moot turned it off at the urging of the other 4chan staffers, all of whom were going to Otakon.

July 21 - The Great Deathly Hallows IRL Raid of 2007 - /b/ gets a leak of Harry Potter's seventh book, obtained from Gaia (Ha!) and proceed to spoiler it for everyone else.

July 23? - /b/'s background music is changed to a remix of "Chocolate Rain" by Tay Zonday.

July 26 – The Fox News Report – HACKERS ON STEROIDS - Fox news makes what is probably most hilariously retarded act of journalism in history. Covering anonymous and internet hackers in ways completely irrelevant, such as showing the footage of an exploding van and that a mother whose son MySpace account got hacked and took to defensive measures such as buying a dog. They coined many memes such as HACKERS ON STEROIDS, INTERNET HATE MACHINE, buy a dog, exploding van and lulz, a corruption of lol.

July 27 - /b/ raids the shit out of Fox News, spamming MyFoxLA and MyFoxDC forums until the admins deleted them, getting into a completely unprotected FoxNews.com and stealing the personal info 1.5 million users from ZiffDavis.com via a UNIX script, all blaming whilst eBaumsWorld. Other Anonymous IRL raided the Fox News LA Studio by ordering pizzas, male hookers and fast food and many others things. This raid would have happened the same day but, for a weird reason, no new threads could be created on /b/ during that day.

July 31? - Forced Anon returns on /b/.

July 31 - G4's Attack of the Show's plan to talk about Anon at 4chan created forced names/tripcodes of ATOS's guests and anchors for the day on /b/.

September 11 - /b/tard Trey Burba upload the photograph of a pipe bomb on /b/ claiming that he will bomb his school, however he forgot to remove the EXIF data from the camera and he was Doxed. He later claimed everything was a social experiment but the damage was done, the FBI arrested him the next day. He was charged with felony and received three months of house arrest.

September 21 - Forced Anon is removed from /b/ for some reason, resulting in moot and W.T. Snacks impersonations (among other things).

October 1 - 4chan celebrates its 4th birthday with the return of the purple and blue party hats to /b/. A good time is had by all. The yearly commemoration is made by Mac.

October 19 - 25 – The Caturday Nap - A number of users from Lulznet, previously known as Helldrive IRC, an IRC server that managed to link with many major raid chans of the era (7chan, WTFux, Raidchan, Partyvan.org, 420chan and the Patriotic Nigras) enter the 4chan IRC channel. One of its members, Locutus\_of\_Lulz, demands that it be moved from its current location on irc.rizon.net to irc.partyvan.org/irc.lulz.net. Their request is not taken seriously and they are banned from the channel in short order. During the exchange, moot apathetically replies "irc is stupid" and "i am gonna go make soup". Angered, Lulznet beings a DDoS attack against 4chan. The attack is relatively successful, with all of the 4chan servers' timing out relatively quickly, in response moot simply plugs them out. Simultaneously, Encyclopedia Dramatica attacks Wikichan for the sake of it.

October 20 – With 4chan off the map, /b/tards flock to 7chan and other sites, as usual. 7chan's server cannot take this much traffic and wavers in and out of service. 420chan enters partyhard mode to keep the site out of /b/tards.

October 21 – A 7chan mod decides it's enough and attaches an upgraded version of partyhard.css to /b/, sending everything to hell. Later they decide to DDOS Lulznet, they fail and Lulznet brings their IRC down, and eventually the whole site, though they almost manage to contain it before their host fixes the problem by nulling them for a while. The p4ch3c0 redirects 7chan to Habbo hotel. /b/tards schedule raids while they wait.

October 22 - /b/tards and /i/nsurgents gather at Freechan and begin to plan a counter attack. The surge of users puts the site down for fifteen minutes and the OP of the invasion threads gets banned due to fear of Lulznet retaliation. The Lulznet DDOSs are pulled down, 7chan returns but moot is still hanging on to his soup.

October 24 – They find the Lulznet IRC and DDOS the shit out of them. moot finally runs out of soups and 4chan and /b/ are back with tons of OC, copypasta and a new meme called brb, soup.

October 26 – No Cussing Club raid - /b/ decided to raid a kids club that, as the name suggests, was against swearing and somehow managed to get the praise of a governor. Simultaneously, new measures are planted on /b/ to stem the tide of newfaggotry. As a result, the possibility of combos was eliminated, the #fortune ability was disabled, and the cancer's hold on the board was reduced somewhat.

November 5 – The EFG Day Raid – Commemorating the anniversary of V for Vendetta, anon change the classical nigras for a new model resembling the V for Vendetta character. Though extremely unorganized and failing most of its activities, the raid of notorious for managing huge swastigets and other forms of /b/lockade.

December – moot changes the front page

December 14 – BRB, compromised - IDIDITFORTHELULZ.net obtains moot's domain password, hereby taking control of 4chan by having CeLe, owner of Glexia.com, 4chan's hosting, hand them over. CeLe was a good friend of DIDITFORTHELULZ's admin, XyriX. Together with his team [Lulz] and his girlfriend Angyl they tried to make a "4chan for the people". There is a recorded phone conversation where Angyl tries to get a fansign picture of a very angry moot in exchange for giving them the site back. Glexia suspended 4chan's and teamdouche's (Angyl's former team) accounts after they Dox'd Angyl together with Anonymous Borg (Locutus\_of\_loli, actor in the Caturday Nap). Why they helped, its unknown. moot got the site back after he gave the ransom. I wonder where the pictures are.

December 21 – The FBI makes reports the arrest of Trey Burba in their website, showing that they really don't have any idea of how /b/ works.

December 30 – Hal Turner announces that he is closing his site. In a last moment, 7channers and anons from #insurgency tell the g00ns, who used their actual hacker skills to steal all the data regarding donations and subscribers. It turns out Hal made more money from the former than the latter. Plus that bandwidth totaled way less than he told.

# 2008

March 6 – Tom Green gets raided again. This time anons called, asking him to do stuff like a successful gentlemen re-enactment, time-stamping his hand and finally gets an anon who decides to shout FAT NIGGER six times until he's cut. Around here was when the infamous raid channel #tomgreen was born.

March 17 – Another Tom Green raid, he befriends a caller on Skype and decides to let him on and call another caller. The first one was cut short because he began to shout FAT NIGGER, now a Tom Green classic.

May 2 – /b/-day 2 - Out of curiosity, moot decides to turn /b/ off for one day. The ensuing wave of adrift /b/tards, with no place to go since 7chan was pretending to be bought by 4chan, redirecting to the site, they flocked at /r9k/. There, they discovered that they could impersonate moot, and decided to flood the shit out of everything. As the day progressed more and more /b/tards drifted towards the other boards, mainly /r9k/, /k/, /s/ and /x/.

May 22 – Operation Jewtube – In response to protests from My Chemical Romance fans regarding criticism of the band, /i/nsurgents from Britchan troll the media by making videos about the protest, adding a final note telling that they were going to kill themselves at the end.

_fail - and its consumption of /b/, has become an unstoppable cancer._
_/b/ has changed._" "This is our final mission" was written on the announcements. Before, the title/ has already been renamed /vaporeon/," "/tom/" and "/b/oston." The board was later locked, and unlocked with two stickies. Confused /b/tards though this was it, /b/ was going to be deleted and vowed to at least try to kill the cancer, the cancerous threads became "One last X" threads and other vowed to delete their /b/ folder. However, on other boards, a small text appeared: **"today, 6/18. Boston common. park street. 7pm.".** By 7PM, a link to an USTREAM video was posted on all the boards.

July 12 – /b/tards all over the \*chans joined in Habbo Canada to raid. The zerg rush was absolute and very unorganized, even though the veteran nigras made tools for the newfags.

Tom Green decided to challenge his users to play "the game" – As long as his view count never dropped he would keep taking calls. #tomgreen began to call for /b/lackup on 4chan, 7chan, 420chan and many other sites, and soon the view counts tripled. Botnets were assembled to create fake views and cries of FAT NIGGERS flowed from the phone. Tom Green lost it, shouted "Fuck you, man" at the last caller, torn the phone cable, shouted "PHONES ARE BULLSHIT" whilst leaving and closed the show with a final "See ya, pricks".

Every single post is wordfiltered to "ROW ROW FIGTH THE POWAH". A small, clickable fyi link appears under the comment field, which leads to a giant. /b/ proceeds to evacuate the board and raids the fuck out of /trv/ and various other boards. The next stop was /v/, but the raid was met with strong retaliation. Eventually this inspired /v/ tripfag 3 Angled Blue to make the Rage Vs. Cancer comic depicting the civil war, and it got such a rise in popularity that /v/irgins got together and made the popular V-rage flash. 3AB then made a sequel comic and an unfinished conclusion in flash.

September 16 – /b/tard David Kernel hacks into Sarah Palin's email by guessing the secret questions, looking to derail his campaign. However he's scared of being discovered and posts the password on /b/ under the name of Rubico. Subsequently, another user changes the password and posts a screencap, but forgets to censor it. Besides getting labeled a white knight, the account gets the password changed a third time, but due to Yahoo policy it gets locked. Rubico essentially showed /b/ all the information necessary to get v&, including his email, his American Proxy. moot gets called into court to testify against David.

September 17 – Rubico posts his story of how he did it, it immediately becomes a copypasta. The news get on the old media and an Internet poll held by Fox News's host Greta Van Susteren over the issue, asking what the users though about the incident, if it was a harmless prank or a political move. Anonymous was aware of this and immediately clicked the prank option. However when the polls turned to 67% in favour of the prank the host claimed they got hacked. After the show was over they rigged the poll so you could no longer select the prank option. 4chan then proceeded to spam the comments section. A thread erupts laughing at how moot will get v& because of it, and moot responds by changing the title to "/b/ - DESPICABLE, SLIMMY, SCUMMY" with the subtitle "Remix". He then embedded a remix of Row Row Fight the Powah.

September 20 - Rubico gets arrested and his house is investigated. It ends up he's the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell. /b/ attempts to DDOS and Raid Bill O'Reily, who was dissing the site at the time but they fail to incite any reaction.

December 27 – Prelude to Boxxy - 4chan was due for unknown reasons, and on 7chan's /b/, now roaring with 4chan's /b/tards, a video of a strangely tantalizing teenager was embedded under the name of FOAR 4DD1 FRUM BOXXY.

# 2009

January 1 – The great No Cussing Club Raid – /b/tards chan-wide IRL raid McKay, creator of the No Cussing Club by sending him porn magazines, pizza and death threats. On 4chan, /b/ was back, and the boxxy video was the subject of many "You rage, you lose" and "You fall in love, you lose" threads. Opinions on boxxy where divided, and conflicted, submerging the board in a flame war. Enraged newfags and oldfags spammed her comments section and days later boxy closed her Youtube channel, boxybabe.

January 7 – Boxxy discovers her fans and decides to lurk /b/. There, she posted two pics of herself, but was called out as a fake, to prove her pictures; she made a second account, boxybabee, and uploaded a third video acknowledging /b/. At that point, everything went to hell.

However it seems he did not pay for the Sushi, because he's seen eating a Hamburger at the end of the show.

May 5 - /b/ DDOS's itself - /b/ and /r9k/ grinded to a halt by DDOS, everyone suspects 711chan is to blame. However it was later discovered that users downloaded an image that contained a DDOS script without realizing. The attack continued an entire week.

May 19 - YouTube Porn Day - /b/ - "...what would happen if ALL of us upload porn on YouTube non-stop?". /b/-tards planned the raid by uploading the porn in private videos with the tags marblecake, and released them all in the same day with the tag Marblecake. Even though the operation started too early due to timelines, Youtube was still clogged with porn, creating the memes "I'm 12 years old and what is this" and Marblecake.

May 29 - moot posts a sticky called "Re:spam" with an image titled crockofshit.png

June 1 - /b/ title changed to "Twilight Appreciation Station - The darkest place on the internet -- for vampire compatriots"

June 12 – Second Youtube Porn Day – Though a failure, the idea was to set them all to private without the original tag and make them public.

June 18 – A year after the events of the old /b/ day, /b/'s title changed to "you forgot - it was your final mission nothing will save you now." On the other boards, the meet up was scheduled at Washington Square, and this time, moot was there.

July 12 - moot makes a global announcement stating that he might use Twitter "(ugh)" for site updates in addition to other stuff. (Despite the initial feelings about twitter, he eventually learns to enjoy it.) . On the same day, /b/tards find a messageboard, "iheartboxxy", a small group of users found two videos of Boxxy filmed by her friends attending the 2009 Spring California Thespin Festival. Regarding themselves as a council, one of the members got d0x and /b/ threatened to raid him if they did not show the videos. Eventually the admin of the website obliged and uploaded them.

July 25 - BoxxPeace – Sequel to BoxxMeet. A group of anonymous stalkers use her d0x to meet up at her neighborhood and bring her gifts. Given that this is the second time it happens, they found a chair on her front gates. They rang the bell but no one answered. They left some flowers in front of the gates with the word "Anon". They later found her ex-boyfriend, Dan Birlen, though Boxxy never appeared. Over the months a new wave of pictures would appear, obtained by "Calif4nia", an user of Killwebs.com, who got them by flirting with a friend of Boxxy, Niki, for months. He watermarked them with his site's logo and blurred them. However, anonymous managed to fix the pictures and doxed callif4nia, whose team later shut down Killwebs.com.

July 27 – AT&T blocks 4chan - moot attempts to reduce damage from having AnonTalk DDOS them with dire consequences: AT&T blocks 4chan's /r9k/ and /b/ more specifically the img.4chan.org sub domain was blocked. The entire site rises in arm in retaliation, but the matter is soon cleared and the block lifted. Moot used the opportunity to talk about Internet censorship

September - Gamespot.com hosted a tournament, where its users voted to decide who the greatest video game character of all time is. 4chan decided to trash this party. Anonymous decided to have Duke Nukem, Little mac and /b/ubble & /b/bobble come out at the top. Especially /b/u/b/ & /b/o/b/. At the first round of the tournament, bub & bob were against the mighty master chief. Master Chief was no match for bub & bob, since the Gamespot community wasn't prepared for a raid such as this. Much lulz was had, as bub & bob, a game that most people haven't heard of defeated master chief. bub & bob defeated sonic easily in the next round, and faced Samus in round 3. It was an incredibly tight match. Hackers from both sides pulled all-nighters. As a result, bub & bob won with 53% of the votes. Sadly, the Gamespot admins disqualified bub & bob because they caught 5 specific people who submitted 16K votes. bub & bob won the battle, but Samus had won the war. Due to the raid, the word 4chan was banned from the Gamespot forums. The Gamespot community now refers to 4chan as mordor.

August 20 – Tom Green runs another Skype show, with an anon offering to sings the FAT NIGGER song, the second anon puts on a charade for five minutes until finally fapping on camera, and the third anon gurgles cum on the air.

October 1 - 4chan turned 6 years old. The party hats return once again. /b/ crashes due to delicious cake. As usual, /b/ flees to /x/. The server crashes twice more until all of 4chan.img is down. Mac makes his third commemoration.

December 10 – The Boxxy videos get taken down by somebody named Lia Dawson, claiming that Boxxy is a registered trademark of the Lia Dawson & Frank Dawson Network. It was later discovered that Boxxy was an actual registered trademark of Oudipo, Inc. and that they renewed the trademark on December 2009. However, user ChrissyRin ousted the scammers for what they were, hoping to attain money from the Youtube videos of Boxxy and other 20 Youtube accounts.

December 14 – The account gets reactivated but without any videos, which were restored days later. The Lia account was abandoned and later hacked into and suspended in January.

December 26 – BoxxMass – Boxxy fans meet up at Robert Doyle Park, Roseville, and bring gifts for her. However there's no known footage.

# 2010

January 25 - Six new image boards were added: "/adv/ - Advice", "/lit/ - Literature", "/new/ - News", "/int/ - International", "/sci/ - Science & Math", and "/3/ - 3DCG" is brought back.

January 26 - The start of the longest ever collab thread in the history of 4chan on /3/. The last time I checked as of 3/17/2012 it was incomplete.

February - A sticky was created on /b/, where moot asked what he should mention for his presentation for TED Talks. The thread received over 12K posts. moot described anonymous to a bunch of confiscates in 70 different countries (wait until all those people go on 4chan, realizing that 4chan is dead and full of porn) on TED Talks. He claimed 4chan was dying due to the movement towards internet privacy. moot also reviled that he moved out of his mom's house and back to college.

February - Massive Q and A threads on /a/, /jp/, and /r9k/. Moot created a formspring page for Q and A things but it was flooded with 20,000 messages. Around 2012 he quietly replaced the formspring page with the 4chan FAQ.

February 4 - Verizon users started experiencing problems loading 4chan. Soon moot confirmed with Verizon customer support that 4chan was blocked on purpose. Verizon took a week to "resolve" the situation

February 21 - 200M GET on /b/ featured an image of Ninetails, a Pokemon. On that same date, moot implemented post number truncation in response to the Bateman/Doubles Guy posts on /b, but they simply moved to /a/ and /v/ to spread this cancer.

February 23 - a clue was featured on Jeopardy in a category entitled 'Internet' containing a reference to 4chan.org. moot posted an image about the broadcast.

February 26 – HARMONY - A /v/irgin delves into the depths of Adult Swim's flash section and finds a single game – Robot Unicorn Attack. The /v/irgin, felt something weird… something new. For the first time he actually liked a game. So he went to /v/ to tell the news.

February 27 –Robot Unicorn Attack invades the entirety of /v/ and leaks into /a/, /jp/, /co/, /m/. /tg/, /k/, /x/ and /mu/. Many tripfags contributed, MFGreth1 added it on wiki recommended games list, Gay Purple Man, began streaming the game, BaconShota made #robotunicornattack, lordofhet started a group on Steam. Hundreds of /v/irgins emailed moot asking him to embed the RUA theme – Always by Erasure – on /v/. And he complied. Surprisingly, the game wasn't even mentioned on /b/, something the /b/tards didn't like. This event, in its own small way, change the way /v/ reacted towards games, from the hate bandwagon to actually admitting what games they liked. This would be a perfect reflection of the cultural changes 4chan went through during 2010.

February 28 - "Over the past 48 hours 4chan's formspring page has gotten over 12,000 questions, and I've received over 3,000 e-mails. Many thanks to everyone who submitted a question, and sent me a message! I was able to respond to a few hundred e-mails and had hoped to start answering questions on formspring, but it seems that the number of questions broke the page. Once that's sorted out, I'll sift through them and answer as time allows. Thanks again for all of the support!" - However this fix never happened due to various reasons.

March 11 – The Boxxy videos are taken down once again, a tripfag from Unichan under the name of Anon77 (An original member of CBRC), posed as Boxxy and convinced Youtube to delete the videos.

May - Law & Order aired an episode where a guy with the internet nickname "moot" tried to beat Cho's high score. This created much outrage. Due to the episode, the Law & Order commercial transition (full black screen with the sound effect DUN DUN) appeared after every time someone posts on 4chan's /b/ with the only text being the date of the post submission.

May 4 - /r9k/ discovers Quiptext's vulnerability, /b/ founds out about it and Quiptext day was begun.

June 17 – On January, an image with the word "June 17. She will return" was spammed since, /b/tards across all the chan baaaw as Boxxy didn't return. Simultaneously /b/ manages to get "nigger" on Google Trends.

July 4 – Youtube Independence Day - /v/irgins discover and exploit in the comments sections and proceed to insert HTML codes into every damn videos of Youtube, redirecting many to the Last Measure, Goatse and many other things.

July 14 – The Jessi Slaughter Saga - A video of Jessica Leonhardt, known as Jessi Slaughter, complaining about being harassed was posted on /b/. Shortly after, Leonhardt was inundated with attacks on the micro blogging site Tumblr. Later that night, Leonhardt uploaded a response video in which her father warned attackers that they would found proclaiming "YOU DUN GOOFED".

July 15 - Anonymous soon uncovered her personal information including phone number, address and her Twitter account. People soon began flooding the Leonhardt' household with prank calls and hate e-mails. In a Stickam video uploaded on July 15th, Jessi is seen answering the phone during one of the prank calls. Following the relentless waves of harassment carried out by the trolls, Jessi posted a tearful response video on YouTube, in which her father Gene Leonhardt suddenly comes into the shot and delivers an angry rant.

July 18 – Gawker reports that Jessi slaughter has been put under police protection. Anon rejoices.

July 19 – Adrian Chen, covering the Jessi Slaughter events made an article called "The Art of Trolling: Inside a 4chan Smear Campaign." After outlining 4chan's plan of attack against Dahvie Vanity with screenshots and links, Chen linked to a chatroom, daring readers to troll it. Enraged, /b/ set out to take down Gawker's main servers around noon on July 19th. When the site did not go down, an attack against Adrian Chen was launched. Gawker posted an article detailing the entire plot, stating that they were not afraid.

July 21 - /b/ is told that Jessi Slaughter will appear on Good Morning America! the following day. /b/ panics, factions rise, one wanting to spam /b/ to keep off potential newfags and one wanting to make /b/ the complete opposite of what will be reported on the TV. The later faction won. Operation /b/ipolar begins.

July 22 – Operation /b/ipolar - /b/'s rules change, along with embedded music and a new sticky thread in "honor" of, ABC's Good Morning Coverage of Jessi Slaughter. /b/ was ready to for the income of new users thanks to Operation /b/ipolar, but in the end it never happened, Jessi wizens up and doesn't mention 4chan.

July 23 – In the end, Good Morning America! did mention 4chan in the night shift airing, causing /b/ to panic again. But before it could re-start Operation /b/ipolar, a massive wave of spam crashes /b/. /b/tards flee to /a/ and later /x/, who welcomes them with open, ghostly arms.

July 24 – In response to the spam, moot awakes from his soup-induced hibernation and establishes reCAPTCHA for some minutes, but later removes it.

August 7 – The Boxxy videos are back up.

September 17 – AnonTalk dies, after being spammed endlessly by Minichan, their clone site, since April 13.

September 22 – AnonTalk returns. To everyone's dismay.

September 25 – moot fills /b/ with falling dongs.

October 1 - 4chan turns 7 years old today. He chatted as MOOTCHAT on Meebo and AIM via airplane internet. But that didn't work out, so he created #4chanbirthday @ irc.rizon.net. Also he mentioned that The Social Network premiered in cinemas in the US. Mac makes yet another commemoration.

October 14 –A single anonymous began hammering AnonTalk with all his might, killing the board a second time.

October 31 – moot posts a picture of him and Boxxy, to everyone's surprise. However it was confirmed by Boxxy herself that they never meet up.

November 4 – Kimmo brings the site back a third time under an American host and DDOS protection. He must really like the site. This time, however, both Tinychan and Minichan had their spambots at the ready.

November 11 – It's discovered that Boxxy is selling her stuff at eBay, she confirms it as Unichan and the news spread like wildfire. The items actually sell at high prices (1000$ for a childhood backpack!)

November 14 - Operation Overlord. A butthurt Tumblr user makes a request of invasion on /b/, but is shunned off by most as it was a personal army request. Still it garnered enough users to catch the attention of the Tumblr user's that browsed 4chan. It prompted them to start Operation Overkitten, flooding /b/ with actual pictures of kittens and the phrase "What is air"
_ **# 27** _. In response, /b/ attempts to DDOS Tumblr but fails, only taking the front page down. Tumblr declares victory and eventually, in the victory flood of /b/, a somewhat clear-headed user of /b/ proposes that, since 4chan is predominantly male, and Tumblr is predominantly female, should have sex with each other. Thus, 4chumblr is born, and a surprising amount of Tumblr girls began to post pics of themselves in you love you lose and tits threads.

November 17 – Operation: Black Rage - In an urge to stop meme culture from going mainstream, /b/ starts making "race guy" comic, racist variants of rage guy, in hopes of getting Hot Topic to stop selling t-shirts. Though initially successful, Hot Topic research the issue and calls out the raid, putting the shirts on sale again.

November 18 - Kimmo Alm, who has been showing a surprising amount of patience towards the wave of spam, finally snaps and raises his entry requirements to impossible limits.

November 19 – Itamake, an enemy of AnonTalk, makes a domain under the same host as them. He puts ALTBBS on the work, which is an exact copy of AnonTalk. Kimmo loses his shit and kills his own site a third time.

November 25 – Boxxy returns with a new video and posts it on Unichan.

November 27 – Kimmo brings the site back again for a third time, this time even more restricted as before. Same old, same old.

December 1 - PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI PUDDI – CSS hack featuring the song PUDDI PUDDI. Many /b/tards flee to /x/ again, in a sort of tradition. After so many times having /x/ handle /b/ refugees, /b/ enacts rule 43 – Due to their always helpful, although sometimes reluctant, attitude /x/ has had toward /b/ all these years and specially due the events of the PUDDI invasion, /x/ will not be raided anymore. This didn't do much however, by the time this happened /x/ was already through the last stages of terminal cancer due to local tripfags.

December 27 – moot goes nuts again. /b/'s title changed to "MOOT IS OLEV OLEV IS MOOT" with the subtext "Where is your god now –or- write moolev on your body!!!" and party mode .html was active.

February 10 - /b/ gets flooded with "FUCK IT /B/ROS, I AM TIRED OF THIS CARDSTAND BULLSHIT. I AM GOING TO FUCK THAT CARDSTAND. GIVE ME 30 MINUTES. IF IT DOESN'T FALL IN 30 MINUTES, I WILL AN HERO MYSELF IN 30 MINUTES…" regarding a meme about a NYC camera that points to a cardstand

February 13 - Andrew W.K. posts on 4chan's /mu/ with two threads. This is the beginning of the end for /mu/, as a flood of off-topic threads began to take over the board, with a special mention to /r9k/ feels.

February 16 – Anonymous finally delivers and knocks down the NYC cardstand.

March 14 - moot had his SXSW 2011 regarding canv.as. 4channers mocked him in countless threads and it was considered to be the worst of all the talks he had about 4chan in history.

April 25 – AnonTalk dies its fourth and final death, Kimmo _finally_ fed off with the board.

May 9 – moot changes /b/ name to "The Most Electrifying Imageboard in Forum Entertainment!" The wordfilters are back: Known wordfilters: Mods – The People's Champions, Fag – Candy-ass, pony – Newt Gingrich, 4chan – Newt Gingrich, ponies – Steve Jobs, nigger – Roody-poo, vagina – VAGINA, brony and bronies – Jabronis, penis – PENIS (With a coloured background), moot – missingno.

June 18 - "_/b/ has changed._
_it's no longer about original content, epic GETs, and win_
_it's an endless series of reposts, perpetuated by newfags and trolls_
_fail - and its consumption of /b/, has become an unstoppable cancer._
_/b/ has changed._" The irony of the "Endless series of reposts" line will not be lost on seasoned /b/tards. Moot embeds the Metal Gear Solid 4 theme again.

July 2 – For some reason /b/ resets to the standard Yotsuba Image Board title, it was later reverted.

August 18 – A final post by Kimmo realizing that there's no possible way he could ever get any money of sorts.

October 26 - "I'm so fresh you can suck my nuts" is stickied on /b/.

November 4 – moot responds to the "Occupy Wall Street" movement by hacking the shit out of /b/'s CSS.

November 8 - /new/ is (accidentally?) revived. No news posts are made, rules given, or mods on it. Title is "Yotsuba Image Board," the default title given to new boards; seems to be a mix of /co/ and /sp/ users with a healthy blend of racism thrown in. Posts from January still made up over half the board. Deadmau5 appears on /mu/ in two sticky threads. The off-topic posts in /mu/ intensify.

November 10 - Moot adds /r9k/ - ROBOT9001, /pol/ - Politically Incorrect, and /hc/ - Hardcore. All three previous board (/r9k/, /new/ and /hc/). Creates /diy/ - Do It Yourself.

November 16 - DDOS dies down

November 17 - Moot has a sticky in /g/. /r9k/ gets spoiler tags thanks to Tage Heyn and people (s)talk about Shii. /v/ becomes El Vidyo and gets Hispanic background music.

November 20 - Moot tries to make pages load more quickly by changing how captchas load. Naturally, this makes captchas stop working altogether. Quick reply/Noko/All non-official 4chan applications stop working and the submit button grays out for a lot of people. I link moot to the thread and after he posts, the thread explodes with people bitching and moot undoes the changes after the thread hits 200 replies about an hour and a half later. (/g/21167645).

November 26 - /sp/ - Ship Posting day – moot completely loses it and changes the name of /sp/ to WE NBA NOW!!!!!!!!!, with the subtitle of "our body is ready". He proceeds to sticky random off-topic threads and ban users with random tags such as [USER WAS RITHMYCALLY SLAPPED FOR THIS POST] or [USER WAS HORSEPLAYED FOR THIS POST] and changing his name to mootdusky. This is due to the state of /sp/ reaching critical mass; moot pretty much gave up on the board.

# 2012

February - moot quietly opens /hm/ to the public after enough requests.

February 4 – /v/ beats Reddit at Tribes Ascend, becomes /v/ - Well-coordinated and heavily practiced Reddit team beaten by a rag-tag group of /v/irgins run by a furry and a BR with 140 ping and gets GAL男宣言 (Galo Sengen) embedded as background music. /v/ is split into /v/ and /vg/. It is now impossible to get dubs on /v/. The /int/ board is occupied by Russian channers from 2ch.so due to a DDoS attack by pro-government groups.

February 14 – During Valentine's Day, moot announces that he is planning to add up to 15 boards, including one to contain the rising brony phenomenon. Later, he reestablished forced anon on /b/ using a 24 hours ID system, essentially making one anonymous without being anonymous. From this day on, the quality of /b/ seems to ameliorate, albeit slowly.

February 17 - Since the cartoon series _My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic_ becomes massively popular, surpassing its /co/ boundaries and adopting a pseudo culture under the name of bronies. moot creates /mlp/ - My Little Pony in order to stop the massive flood of My Little Pony threads on 4chan. Many people though /mlp/ would go the way of Aprils Fur's Day, but it never happened. Some bronies would rather create /b/reads: Threads outside /mlp/ that are essentially a circlejerk between trolls and tripfags, to the point of sharing contacts. /mlp/ has a single stickied thread, posted by moot.

March 7 - /b/'s header is changed to the words "NO SCRUBS ALLOWED" and below that "SEE ABOVE". The song "No Scrubs" by TLC is played in the background. :stopmusic: faggotry ensues. The layout is returned to normal on the next day.

July 6 – moot writes a note talking about bandwidth usage, extensions and asks both add-on developers and users to be reasonable with update intervals.

August – With 4chan's one billionth post looming in, moot replies to two threads on /b/ with his admin tag on. The threads quickly turn into a Questions and answers session between the long forsaken /b/tards and their admin years after the last news post and contact with the staff. Many tears were shed.

August 8 – After 4chan's billionth post, moot posts the first news post in four years. He reopens /q/ as /q/ - 4chan Discussion and states that he plans to start a series of Prime ministers Q/A threads, because he feels he lost touch with the community. Following some suggestions on /q/, avatarfagging becomes a banned offense. There was also a failed attempt at allowing minors to browse 4chan, but was quickly replaced with MINERS because of the huge negative backslash from the community.

With time /q/ is flooded by users from /a/ and /v/, the two boards with the most traffic after /b/, known to be notoriously reactionary. Not long after that, most mods are taken to /v/ to deal with the recent wave of shitposting and the deprecation of /v/ culture. /a/ users keep complaining about undesirable anime threads like Naruto, and how they shouldn't be on /a/. The staff seems to have divided opinions and shift between deleting threads and leaving them be. The following debates backslash when trolls begin to crapflood /a/ with Naruto threads, whilst the rest of /a/ bandwagoned against them. Eventually moot stepped in and clarified that Naruto is /a/ content.

August 10 - moot hacks /a/'s CSS and wordfilters every post to JIBUN WOOOOOOO. He embedded the first opening of Code Geass on the first page.

August 13 – Dub the Dew – 4chan gets hold of Mountain Dew's new naming contest, and together with Reddit hijacks it, making names like "Fapple", "Diabeetus" and "Hitler Did Nothing Wrong" appear on the top. Bronies also join the game, attempting to get Applejack to the top, but they only manage to appear on second place. Later, the site was hacker and the banner "Mtn Dew salutes the Israeli Mossad for demolishing 3 towers on 9/11!" appeared, together with a rickroll and a pop up of "le 9gag are legion".

Many anons joined the cause because they knew it's actually possible to play music for the deaf. Taylor Swift, however had other plans. She convinces the sponsors to disqualify the school and donates the 10000$ herself. And it doesn't stop there, he also get the sponsors to donate themselves, along with three other non-profit companies, and gives ticket for her next gig to all the members of the school. Ending with a whopping 60000$ in donations.

September 5 – On a news post, moot announces that KING JAFFE JOFFER, along with the coder of the Yotsuba Catalog, Desuwa, made a major overhaul of the HMTL5 code, created the inline extensions and added a 4chan JSON API.

September 28 – moot makes a news post clarifying some doubts and questions about the 4chan pass

October 1 – 4chan turns nine years, with the sixth consecutive commemoration from Mac.

October 16 – After a load of consecutive epic thread happening lately, a mod stickies [a loop from the anime Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! With the song Pull Over from Trina embedded on it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9O1TMJyhmw) /b/ rages on weaboos and raids /a/ for it.

Guess the mods are back at sticking shit again. Just like the old times.

October 24 - #baldforbieber – Anonymous decides to troll Justin Bieber fans by spreading fake news of cancer, shooping a picture of Bieber asking people to bald their heads. It's surprisingly successful and in result many lulz were had, a lot of media coverage.

[On a second thread](http://archive.installgentoo.net/g/thread/28950538), Seff himself comes in to clarify the situation: He is building a system to track the shitposters, their threads and their posts to later email them to moot.

The situation got many boards in a panic and Seff was doxed and raided IRL. Later on the same thread moot posted screenshots from Seff's emails, confirming that Seff was a shitposter that ratted everyone out by emailing moot when he realized there was a leak. Still, He wasn't forgiven.

Whether this was a clever act of damage control for when the site was discovered, or Seff was genuinely scared of being discovered, is yet to be seen.

November 10 – Operation Kinder - /b/ attempts to get the unshooped picture of the Osama Beard kid on a new Ukrainian Kinder chocolate. They manage to get it to the second place.

December 29 - [This post](http://archive.foolz.us/q/thread/348577/#q358180) throws some light on the matter of /pol/. Days later a mod took notice and vowed to take the matter to moot.

# 2013

January – moot, together with desuwa, adds an inline catalog

January 7 - #cutforbieber – Anonymous decides to do another joke on believers, in response and uses the opportunity brought by a leaked picture of Justin holding a joint to spread #cutforbieber, urging people to cut themselves. However /b/ did nothing besides the original idea so the GNAA took over. An user made a fake news story of a girl dying from the act.

January 30 - #boobs4bieber - /b/ decides to attempt a new Bieber scam by editing tits out of jailbait pictures and posting them on Twitter. But this time the attack is reported by the media and rejected by /b/tards. They complain that Bieber is an overused target and the attack simply fails to take off. Meanwhile, /mlp/ is renamed to WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? Due to the reaction of the board towards the main character becoming an alicorn, for the sake of new toys.

February – A sticky gets posted on /q/ discussing the possible improvements to the catalog

February 20 – The nokosage function is changed, and now using it shows the user's sage.

February 21 – For a while, all posts quoting another bug out and are hidden from the thread

March – With the sticky finished, the improved catalog gets released.

March 18 – moot adds /asp/ - Alternative Sports, /gd/ - Graphic Design, /out/ - Outdoors, /lgbt/ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender - _Oh God_ - and /vr/ - Retro Games. However there seem to be no /his/ - History nor /quest/ - Quest Games on sight, which were the two most requested boards.

March 31 – moot confirms /s4s/ is here to stay.

April 1 – On April 1 12:00 PM moot adds s4s – Shit 4chan Says under the header of "Unlike the other new boards, this is being added on a permanent basis. If it doesn't pan out or goes unused, you should probably check your privilege." The board gets two stickies – a 5555 Dubs GET and another saying "Post in this thread to have your privilege checked" Later the full joke kick's in and moot changes the format and CSS to make it look like Reddit. On both /s4s/ and /b/ a popup about AdultCatFinder appears. A mod checks everyone's privilege on the second sticky and an empty thread is stickied on /b/.

April 3 - /s4s/ becomes an official 4chan board, becoming a rules-less yellow board under the title of "Shitposting 4n Steroids". But it's not listed on the main page and many people complain about the name change.

April 7 - /vp/ gets renamed to /vp/ - RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD after a certain new pokemon gets released. /s4s/ is renamed again, this time, to Shitp4sterS

May – Recent crack downs on the shitposting of /sp/ and /tv/ (Two long-forgotten, but still alive, boards) lead to many users outright rebelling against the moderation team. On one side, users form /tv/ have long been complaining about constantly celebrity waifu threads, which could take as much as half the board. /sp/'s off-topic posting has been increasing exponentially since 2010. The upset and banned users started spreading images and signing their posts with a hashtag #freesp or #freetv. Though it's agreed that /tv/ has no holding ground to claim celebrity threads to be allowed, moot has agree that he would consider allowing certain classic /sp/ threads such as power level and current even threads.

May 12 – moot opens the third Q/A, fucks with the CSS by forgetting a " and jokes with /s4s/ by giving it comic sans.

June 18 – June /int/ Uprising - /int/ was wiped clean of all its thread and some countries, like UK, Canada and France where banned form the board without explanation. Immediately, users went to /q/ to complain and ask for help. Users from banned countries where even restricted from posting on /q/. /int/erns, already heavily dissatisfied with the staff because they let a completely power tripping janitor ran amok in the board, completely rebelled against the board. /ref/, a board for /int/ "refugees", became the base of operations for the spammers. Determined to make enough ruckus to reverse the changes, /int/erns and /ref/ugees got hold of every communist pic they had and began spamming /int/ with claims of revolution, determined to make the entire board red. The spam proved to much for the /int/ janitor to handle and he stopped deleted threads. /int/ continued spamming the board for the rest of the day. By the next day, everything was back to normal, except the janitor was nowhere to be seen. For the first time in months, /int/ rejoiced. Meanwhile, moot celebrates the anniversary of the Boston fail meet up by re-enacting the old /b/-day. This time, however, instead of a meet up on the other board, he starts two contests on /q/, one about rotating banners (Those things you see on the top page that always have the 4chan tittle) and House Ads (Replacements for the adspace when there are no current adds running)

July 14 - /v/ achieves its 200M GET - after lots of tension, the GET goes to a completely unrelated post in a Pikmin thread, asking, "Also why does everyone crash land trying to get to Earth? Seriously."

July 15 - A thread is posted on /b/ with a link to a contest where you can have a chance to meet Taylor Swift by writing an essay about why you should be considered her biggest fan. The OP urges everyone to vote for a "Charles Z". "Charles" quickly reached 1st place, and on the 19th, the radio station shut down the content for "being compromised". This was followed by other attempts to make "Charles" meet a pop star - rigging a contest by New York City's Z100 to meet Selena Gomez on the 21st, and being followed the next day by another raid on a contest by the same station to meet the Jonas Brothers.

July 19 - /b/ twitter-bombs UFC fighter "War Machine." Raiders insult his family, send him pizzas, post him in the gay section of Craigslist, and almost fool him into deleting system 32. As a result War Machine became enraged and repeatedly punched himself in the head.

July 27 – A harsh critic from GameInformer journalist Martin Beer makes Indie games developer Phil Fish ragequit Twitter and cancel his newest game, Fez 2. /v/ celebrates by making tons of OC, including a new /v/ Sings and countless Youtube videos.

July 31 – A tripfag under the code !DwgeSpOOKY claiming to be an ex-janitor disgruntled with the state of the staff leaks /j/ - janitor info on /sp/, including the janitor application acceptance mail, list of the #janiteam IRC members, many logs and screens of /j/. The moderation teams goes into lockdown mode in record time and deletes all mentions of it on /q/, /b/ and /sp/. His leaks and accounts on the team show that the janitors operate on a hit or miss basis and aren't allowed to express opinions or discuss site culture. He hypothesized such things led to outburst of mass deletion on /jp/ and /tv/ in order to express their frustration. Many users assumed that /q/ poster MQrB8x2X was a janitor based on these leaks.

August 13 – Naruto Day - /a/'s elitism finally goes to far when they dox a 4chan mod who posted on /q/ telling them to stop complaining about moderation.

August 15 - /b/ 500m GET: "poland has best prostitutes, i fucked plenty in london. i hope one is ur wife someday fag 500 mil get" moot makes a headliners called "I for one salute our new polish prostitute overlords". Considered a failGET by some.

August 26 – Thanks Australia – Congratulating Kojima on his 50st birthday, /v/ sends him over a hundred postcards.

He later makes a sticky on /s4s/ where he discusses porn threads on the board, both him and the community decide they should be banned.

He announces that all future Q/A sessions will be livestreamed and removes /q/ and replaces it with a suggestion box (The affectivity of which remains to be seen). He adds a much needed ban log 4chan ban log. Finally, in an act that will live in infamy, he makes sage invisible after almost 10 years of the feature. R.I.P in pieces, Sageman.

September 27 – AWA 2013 starts

September 28 - The aforementioned 10th Anniversary 4chan panel takes place at AWA. As with previous cons. /jp/ changes its title to "/jp/ - Weaponized /a/" with the subtitle "Home of ``Misunderstood Geniuses''. /jp/ watches the 4chan panel on Youtube, and this is ground zero for the shitstorm as the board got hijacked by /b/tards when moot mentioned it as "Weaponized /a/"

The OP of the post received ten thousand replies, doubling the previous record set by a namefag called 'eternal samefig' on the same board, who vowed to reply to his post until 4chan died. The sticky is still up as of January 30 and has 10892 replies.

A Homestuck general is stickied on [s4s].

June 9 – Tumblr shutdown4chan begins to post pictures detailing a planned raid on the site on 4th of July, denouncing it as "Racist, misogynist and pure evil".

July 4 – The Great Tumblr Raid of July 2014 – moot stickies a thread commemorating 4th of July and embeds "United States of Whatever" on /b/, along with a thread on /s4s/. SJWs actually try to raid 4chan. Of course, nobody cared. Eventually /b/ and /pol/ retaliated by counter-raiding Tumblr and flooding popular SJW hashtags with gore and abuse pictures. While SJWs tried to counter flood the tags with cute pictures, the effects were devastating and Tumblr's defeat was absolute. Several users flipped out, some deleted their Tumblrs and allegedly, one users killed herself. This resulted in several Tumblr users making petitions on Change.org to shutdown 4chan.

August 1 – moot posts on the blotter that he has removed the email field and added delayed thread pruning – A form of temporal archiving – on trial period for /a/ and /v/. if all goes well, delayed pruning will be extended to all the bleu boards with minor modifications. The news of the death of the email field are received with lukewarm response and bitterness as another feature disappears for no reason.

August 20 – The Zoe Quinn Scandal – Game developer Zoe Quinn is exposed by her boyfriend to have slept with at least 5 men in the games industry in order to promote her game. Surprisingly, no one of the gaming press speaks about it, and many, including Kotaku, IGN and others jump on her defense. This escalates extremely quickly as dozens of people being to tell accounts regarding her and her group of friends' abuse – Sparking a massive Twitter war between e-celebrities and Zoe's clique, among them Phil Fish, many important members of the indie games' community and SJWs that believe Zoe's claims of harassment. As a method of damage control, Zoe pretends to be hacked by /v/ and gets many Twitter accounts deleted, but the incredibly half-assed move is immediately called out. Outraged, the /v/ community begins to gather all information it can from various accounts.

August 21 – GamerGate - The Twitter war escalates further. The greatest blow is dealt when Phil Fish – The gaming industry's greatest dick, is doxed to the last document by an alleged "Head Mod of /V/". Later Fish decides to sell his company, Polytron, and quit the Internet for good. Many suspect the hack to be another false flag but no conclusive information is gathered. Eventually it is revealed Zoe Quinn used her influences to crash two different Game Jams, the second, The Young Fine Capitalists' Jam, a Kickstarter project about helping women participate in the gaming industry, was in direct competence of her own Game Jam, Rebel Jam. She began a Twitter storm, accusing them of misogyny, got their twitters deleted and their site crashed. Her whole group of friends begins to be seen as one of the causes of the pathetic state the game press and indie game scene is in. /pol/, aware of the entire situation, sees opportunity.

August 22 - /pol/ gets shit done for the first time and convinces /v/ to support TFYC's Game Jam in order to rile up Zoe and the SJWs who claim that 4chan is a hive of misogyny, and actually support egalitarianism and the good aspects of feminism. /v/ not only participates, but convinces the devs of TFYC to count their donations as a single entity and becomes the single biggest backer. On top of that, /v/ achieves a $10000 goal that lets them add their own character to the game. Thus Vivian James is created. In the process of creating the character, many /v/irgins were not happy with the fact that they were actually helping the enemy, but the developers of TYFC were surprisingly supportive of /v/ and 4chan, despite being feminist themselves and /v/'s definitely earned reputation. Eventually those that genuinely wanted to help TYFC and try and improve the state of the Game's Industry, and those that just wanted to rile up the SJWs prevailed.

August 31 – The Fappening – A hacker posts on 4chan's /b/ a set of nudes of celebrity Jennifer Lawrence, and composes a list of over a 100 celebrity nudes he claims to have. A thread on /b/ made by him has bump and image limits disabled until it reaches over 9,000 replies (Reached 10,111 replies) in a non-stickied thread, causing the entire site to lag. Reddit and 4chan explode over the ordeal and go on a massive witch hunt against an engineer called Hamade. Rumours are being told about a deepweb hacker group dedicated to trading celebrity nudes. Lawrence threatens to sue anyone who uploads the pictures. This led to moot having the Lawrence pics be hash tagged and whenever they were uploaded the message: "Error: This image cannot be uploaded because it is the subject of a copyright claim by Jennifer Lawrence. Please refrain from posting it." While trying to fix the issue (Probably due to pressure from Lawrence's lawyers), posting as a whole seemed to go down. The pics were allegedly obtained via iCloud, but Apple has denied the claims. Investigation led to the earlier appearances of the hacker to be from AnonIB. Whether it was Hamade or the hacker ring remains to be seen. There would be several consecutive leaks as the hackers who dealt with celeb leaks declare the scene dead.

September 2 – An anonymous 17 year old kid from /out/ embarks on a 5500km walk from Perth, Western Australia to Sydney, New South Wales.

September 16 – GamerGate is shut down by the moderation team with no explanation. There was a previous attempt where the threads were permasaged because the mods believed them to be raids. At the same time, the feedback form is deleted and all trace of it on the site erased. On a surprising move, moot's mail has also been removed from all contact info. While many Pro-GamerGate /v/irgins called for raids to the site and the working of a rogue mod, the most reasonable minds are suspecting that either moot personally forbid them or the mods are doing something behind moot's back. The pro-GamerGate users flock to 4chon.net, but are eventually expelled and end up in 8chan's /burgers/ - Five Guys Burgers n Fries. However, dissatisfied with the Zoe-centric name, they leave for the same site's /v/ - The Vidya.

September 17 – Milo Yiannopoulos, journalist, uncovers that the majority of the Game Journalism scene kept each other in contact via a private Google Doc. There they would discuss what Game to review, what game to ignore and what to post about, including their involvement in the games they review. This is a major breach of the American concept of journalistic integrity and effectively evaporates the last ounce of credibility the journalists had.

September 18 – moot, once again, awakes from his soup slumber and makes a sticky on /v/. Here he explains the reason for the removal of the GamerGate threads was actually because they fit the calls for invasion ban a la Chanology, and that the previous actions of the moderation where due to miscommunication (you gotta wonder how they managed to pull that off). This marks the end of 4chan's events regarding GamerGate, it also points out that the moderation team is somewhat inept at communicating moot's intentions (IE: Not doing it at all) and that any "outwards" action from 4chan's communities would be against the rules, yet according to the rules only invasions and raids are against are forbidden. Pro GamerGate people would start to spam 4chan advertising their new adoptive home, 8chan, for a couple of weeks. GamerGate remained a massive hot topic on several boards, and after a while mods just decided to let it go as long as nobody explicitly made a thread about it. After achieving all a chan movement could achieve, pro GGs would go on to fight a losing war, including having Jimbo Wales himself condemn omitting the pro GG arguments in its Wikipedia page and Zoe Quinn appearing on the BBC.

September 22 – moot is discovered to have been in a "close personal friendship" with Mallory Blair, tech scene celebrity and Gawker Media writer. She wrote her college thesis about him. However recent social media pictures show her having another boyfriend, so it becomes popular at 4chan to claim moot is a cuck.

October 1 – 11 birthdays, 11 faget hats. At the same time, October 1 - The 17 year old kid from /out/, now titled Little Thor by the community passes the 1000km mark

October 19 - Little Thor drops out after 1200km

November 5 – The 4chan Killer - A murderer who strangled his girlfriend and uploaded pictures of her corpse on 4chan is apprehended. Judging by the media coverage, being associated with 4chan trumps the fact that an innocent girl died.

November 9 – moot makes a blog post announcing the addition of auto-watch features and a unique poster count to the site. He also officially announces that delayed thread pruning has been extended to all the boards sans /b/ and /f/.

November 14 – stop to my /b/eat - moot renames /b/ to "stop to my /b/eat" and embeds a Youtube video of the same name by deathtrips, known for making music remixes of his dog barking. The next day, deathtrips renames the video to "go away 4chan" and disables comments. He later realizes he's causing a Streisand effect and restores everything back. By now the feedback form has returned.

November 17 - /b/ is back to normal

November 21 – moot makes a new blog post, saying that janitors now have the ability of request warns instead of bans. He also states that roughly 90% of the 4chan users are lurkers and only 10% of the 20 million monthly users actually posts. His suggestion that recommendation threads on /a/ are not ban-worthy but only deserve a warning causes a shitstorm in the board. He also illustrates some changes in the mobile version of the site.

November 23 - A new sticky on /co/ restating the rules is posted. Due to the vague definition of the furry ban in the thread, users raise concerns questioning if the mods know the difference between normal anthro /co/ related content and furry content. Mods on #4chan dismiss the issue stating the sticky is mainly meant to curb flavours of the month and furry porn threads.

December 4 – Asuka's Birthday.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0) is embedded into every board along with Chen pictures and signs stating "No honk allowed". /a/ gets renamed to "USAKA" with the subtitle "USAKA IS LUUV USAKA IS LUUF". moot posts on /a/ sending the board into chaos, and he also makes a post stating "ayy lmao" in a BANE? thread on /pol/.

December 7 – The /pol/apocalypse - Cartoonist Ben Garrison made a blog post blaming moot for /pol/'s edits of his works and threaten to sue him. He includes a cartoon of him with the text "The CEO of Troll, Inc. – moot". Hours later, moot goes completely nuts and decides to rape /pol/ into submission. It starts with the addition of multiple wordfilters, e.g. "moot" becomes "the CEO of Troll, Inc.", and "cuck" becomes "cluck". More word filters are added as the day progresses. 4chan temporarily goes down for maintenance, and comes back a few hours later. Several threads are stickied - the first is a locked "FOR FREE" thread mocking janitors, and the second is a picture of moot getting fucked by Anita and Zoe. /pol/ gets reCAPTCHA removed and its flags are removed. moot advertises the event in a global announcement with the liner "We're testing CAPTCHA-less posting on /pol/—feel free to give it a whirl. " /pol/ immediately goes to hell as half the site spams the shit out of the board. Another sticky is added, this time saying "POST YFW THE CAPTCHA IS GONE". The post timer is later reduced to 15 seconds, and the global announcement is edited to say "Now with legacy timers!" Then the timer for creating threads is reduced to 1 minute. All posts are turned into dubs by adding an extra digit identical to the last digit at the end of the post number, which causes chaos as people are unable to link to previous posts. At the request of an Anon on [s4s], a moderator stickies a thread that repeats the phrase "wew lad" over and over. Furry porn, guro, loli and ponies are posted with little retaliation from the mods, although some threads are deleted. The board goes apeshit as the users try to flee to /mlp/, /int/, [s4s], and other boards to no avail. After a couple of hours the "wew lad" and "POST YFW THE CAPTCHA IS GONE" stickies are removed, but the cuck sticky and janitor sticky remain. The audio cuck\_class.mp3 from [The 8 Steps of Cuckolding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk) is embedded into the front page (something he hasn't done in at least 2 years) and the board is renamed to " **The 8 Steps of Cuckolding**", with subtitle _">she does it for fun._" A feature is added which makes every post be preceded by "[trigger warning]", later given a marquee animation. The fortune function is added and later changed to say "Your privilege:" instead of "your fortune:" and "Cuck" instead of "Luck". People had been typing "moot ## Admin ⌘" in the subject field to impersonate moot, so the subject field is renamed "moot ## Admin ⌘" as a joke. Two threads are stickied; one is Unicode art of an anime girl, the other is a sticky request. They are both locked and unstickied later on. Site consensus is that /pol/ is about to get deleted. /pol/, in retaliation, raids moot's chosen people, [s4s], and successfully floods their catalog with /pol/ memes. On an interesting display, /pol/ refugees head towards /lgbt/, finally accepting them as their ally. Ben Garrison's post was deleted shortly after.

December 9 – moot introduces Google's new "No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA", which enables some users to bypass the captcha entirely. This however broke posting in all unofficial apps. A meta thread on /b/ asking about the recent rumours of moot being a SJW ends up with moot publicly firing a janitor after he gave some insight.

December 10 -  /pol/'s 39999999 GET, containing a Naruto page edited to be a dubs pic, is stickied & locked, while the 40M GET, simply consisting of "HITLER WAS RIGHT!", happens in a GET thread and quickly goes 404. /pol/'s title is changed back to "/pol/ - Politically Incorrect", and the embedded audio is removed, but the stickies and the other effects still remain. [s4s]'s font is changed to Comic Sans.

December 11 - ID's are removed from /b/, and dubs are allowed back, while /pol/ gets named back to /pol/ - Politically Incorrect. Both boards have a techno song called "I am a robot" embedded and a sticky on the bottom of the board titled I AM A ROBOT, with a dancing robot .gif and a .gif of Google's new reCAPTCHA system. /b/ also gets the captcha removed and old post timers restored like /pol, and is flooded by a spambot whose owner is Bui, a /vp/ tripfag & ban evader known for spamming Goodra porn threads. moot makes a 4chanblog post saying that the no CAPTCHA system allowed 30% of all posts to bypass the captcha. (Previous stats: 90% pass – 10% fail, modern stats: 30% no CAPTCHA - 60% pass – 10% fail).

December - /pol/ is given IDs when a /b/ user requests moot to bring back IDs, and moot says the user didn't specify which board.

December 13 – /b/ celebrates with a check fest. He also participated in a improvised Q&A session in /pol/, dispelling rumors about him selling 4chan, deleting /pol/ and him being a cuck, along with several other topics. IDs on /pol/ are different for every post, regardless of poster's IP, thanks to a user suggestion. Two threads are stickied on /pol/ - one asking if newpol stands with Israel, the other stating "this is nice board".

December 14 – moot has another Q&A session in /pol/ in a random thread. Still, he hasn't done anything to alleviate /pol/'s sodomisation.

December 15 - /pol/'s rape continues. moot removed the music and robot sticky and added geolocation flag

December 16 – moot offers pro-rated refunds to all pass users who bought it before and during December 8, he feels the new CAPTCHA system has greatly diminished their value. He writes the details on the 4chan Blog

December 22 - /a/'s famous mod, kinomod, nick Kusanagi/Kami, gets banned due to a fight with a fellow janitor (yetsturdy). Moot reminds everyone that any sort of discussion between the staff is grounds for immediate termination, and /a/ rebels because of the noticeable changes in moderation, given that Kinomod was extremely lenient with /a/ culture shitposting

**2015**

January 9 – After two months and two days of constant rape, /pol/ is finally restored back to normal, with an upgraded sticky.

January 17 – moot makes Team 4chan sign an agreement that makes official voluntaries to the site and forces them to agree to permanent non-disclosure terms. The agreement must be signed with their digital signature and a picture of any identifying document. moot would hold the dox in his HDD, encrypted. At least 2, and perhaps more, staff members resign. moot later posts the full contract in the 4chan blog

January 18 – Upon finding out about the new agreement, andonuts, inconspicuous janitor, leaked 3 years' worth of #janiteam logs to 8chan admin, Hotwheels. Soon the leaks are out and chaos explodes in the entire site. The situation was quickly contained, however.

January 21 – moot resigns 4chan – moot makes a massive announcement regarding a news post where he announces his official retirement from 4chan. He describes himself as the site's single point of failure and declares that his activity in the last two years happened with the idea of 4chan surviving him in mind. He says the site is economically prepared to survive him and that he'll leave the site to the following senior moderators: The main coder (Mr. VacBob), the moderator manager (RapeApe?) and the server administrator (unknown). He also adds some hard data about the site's total views, total posts (over 170000000), total staff members (104) and other trivia. He doesn't explain why the he has decided to leave the site, however his departure is mourned by all. /b/ gets a Joan Baez Youtube song on its front.

January 22 – moot's favourite board, /a/, gets renamed to "It /a/ll returns to nothing." With the subtitle "tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down"

January 23 – 4chan slows down, probable cause is DDoS. Second opinion is the server administration killing himself upon realizing he now leads 4chan.

January 24 – moot's final livestreamed Q/A session is scheduled for Friday at 2:00 PM, the staff opens /qa/ - Questions & Answers for the moment. The sessions is livestream through Youtube and lasts well over 8 hours.

January 25 - /qa/ is put on permanent archive mode so people can read the questions. Everyone says their final farewells to Christopher Poole.

/z/ - ¿¿?? – A random board which whose rules where the ZOMG NONE!!!one rule that now resides on /b/'s rules. Users would select their mods via popular vote like the idiot kings of SA's FYAD. The first board mod was Soviet\_Russia, known for being a massive tripfag (according to some, he was a mod prior /z/, but that seems unlikely). He ran the board to the ground and was eventually banned. The board was deleted and replaced with the infamous beecock macro "oh noes the board is gone". At one time, he embedded 56000 images on the board, and the tag /z/ - 56k would remain on the title for months. When the board was deleted, it was replaced with the image of a penis covered in bees with the text "oh noes the board is gone!!1". That macro would remain on 4chan until April 2014.

/5/ - 5 – Board created for the mod and WTSnacks' friend 5. Only posts about 5 or about five objects where allowed.

/fk/ - For Kidz – Joke board about making a 4chan for kids. Deleted on 2014.

/n/ - TRAINZ – Early test board for trains, later moved to 1chan

/yg/ - Yogurt and something about danimals.

/j/ - Janitors. Later Janitor & Moderator Discussion. Secret HQ where all the world domination plans are schemed.

moot (aka Robert Bopkins) - Christopher Poole - Admin, Rizon IRC cop, owner of 4chan LLC, humble and stubborn to the point of being annoying. When the Rizon 4chan IRC was made, his very first words where "I wish to be the little girl". Somewhat impulsive, which led him to add and remove forced anonymous and IDs from /b/ and other boards on several consecutive times. He dated Maddeth during 2008, was cucked by an undisclosed someone during 2014. Resigned on January 21, 2015. Mourned by all.

KING JAFFE JOFFER - Coder, translated the 4chan Firefox extension to Google Chrome, and refracted the entirety of 4chan's HTML5 code. Resigned circa 2013-2014.

Anonymous-san - asan - Josh (Popularly known as modcat) - #rasberryheaven, goon – Mod since pretty much the beginnings on 4chan, supposedly quitted around April 25, 2012 because he was trying to contact a girl in his circle of friends (Which happens to include moot) or a girl from /soc/, sources vary a lot, and asked for advice on /soc/. He then used the warn function to give his contact info to female posters who were helping, but one flipped her shit out fear of being banned, and another ratted him out with moot who fired him. Some say he asked to have his powers revoked and moot complied. Others say he later asked him to have his mod status back, but moot is the hero 4chan deserves but not the one it needs and denied it. moot later confirmed he resigned during a Q&A on /pol/

Shii – Menchi (Sources vary, to this day its unknown whether they are the same person, mods claim they are not) - #rasberryheaven, goon - [http://www.shii.org/](http://www.shii.org/) - [http://aya.shii.org/](http://aya.shii.org/) and many more – Biggest English Textboard/Imageboard personality before Snacks. Tried to take down 4chan due to loli, but quickly had a change of heart. Member of world2ch (posted as Menchi), later helped moot to code the site on its beginnings by further translating 0ch's PHP (Though not flawlessly) and maintained the textboards. Got banned from Something Awful during the loli purge. He was active from 2003 to 2005, when moot deemed him too dramatic to be a mod. – According to the Aussie modleaks, still a mod as Menchi. Or at least still retaining his privileges but no longer moderating. He is also a Web Archive admin (And deleted some evidence of his involvement in world2ch and 4chan saved in there) and a Wikipedia admin (Where he stored a list of all his loli anime pages). Mod at /dqn/ and /saovq/.

W.T. Snacks - [http://cookiethievery.com/](http://cookiethievery.com/) - [http://snidnightmacks.tumblr.com/](http://snidnightmacks.tumblr.com/) - Admin. Coder. Internet Meme. Greatest attention-whore to ever grace 4chan. Started during 4chan's revival and made a lot of vital changes to the futallaby code (Reply with an image, quoting, information about posts, being able to see the amount of hidden posts in a thread, also hiding the post from a thread in the first place) Got fired on 2005 due to laziness and moot's lovely bad temper. Used to browse #4chan and advertise his own radio show, Midnight Snacks, which is hosted on 88chan. It's about mini-mixes, remixes and general electronic music. The dude seems to have a knack for it since the Soulseek days. Recently broke his hip skateboarding and now has a nice 60000 bucks debt.

Censored Vagina (AKA C\_V) - #rasberryheaven, goon – Admin and a sort of bridge between the community and moot during the early days. Convinced moot to restore /I/ - Lolicon when it got taken down due to CP. Active from 2003 to 2004. He was permabanned from SA due to pedophilia/lolicon.

5 - Had his own secret board dedicated to pictures of him, created by WTSnacks as an in-joke. He was and is Snacks best friend. A few months after Snacks got demodded he stickied a Midnight Snacks thread, which he co-hosted at the time, the thread was unstickied by moot, and then re-stickied. Because of this people believed a mod war was raging and shouted the meme BRING BACK SNACKS. Jokingly, both users called the show "Radio free 4chan" for the night. This and a streak of inactivity cost 5 his mod status. moot later claimed it was a demoddable offense to sticky radio show threads.

Dongfix (AKA Enumeric) - Imgbear.com – Coder, he has written many scripts for the mods and janitors. IRC rat. Resigned on 2013.

Xennon – Flash coder - Admin for one day because of a GET. Supposedly leaked the logs where Snacks was fired by moot.

Soviet\_Russia – SoRu – 4chan Mod and famous tripfag, made mod in the legendary board /z/ and attention-whored it to death alongside his brother Dash\_Billions. He was eventually banned.

Shut – John - #rasberryheaven goon - Coded around by the time W.T. Snacks was fired (2005) active as far back as 06/2004 and as late as 2007. He maintained the devblog, fixed a bug that allowed huge files on the site if they were .btm.

thatdog - SA/ADTRW goon - [http://www.1chan.net/](http://www.1chan.net/) - Goon that helped coding that PHP around 2003, created the test board /r/ - TRAINZ, funded the site 1chan to satisfy his need for TRAINZ. His website also contains the original overchan, and old, outdated list of \*chans. Look there for a piece of the past. Made Futaba-SQL and the beta archive, futallaby around 2003, But got in an argument with moot and dropped support during early 2004 (moot apparently had great skill when it comes to angering people who helps him)

Allyson – underage b& mod from circa 2006. She was kind of a drama whore

Lec

Kusanagi (aka KusKus / brbgone2gensokyo) – Kinomod, the famous /a/ mod. He was known for everyone extremely favoring and encouraging of /a/ board culture. He was also known for having blut political opinions on IRC. On December 22, he got into a fight with Destati on #janiteam and both where banned by moot. The change of mods in /a/ was noticed inmediately and let to small wave of shitpsoting.

yetsturdy (AKA thisisacleverpassword ) (Originally fsdfdsf) – /a/ and /mlp/ Janitor. Got into a fight with Kusanagi and got fired on December 22, 2014

Inspector Redwood – Mod, famous /co/ tripfag for years, who ultimately got ousted during the 2014 aussie leaks and had to stop using the trip. He used to publicly ban people who called others nigger and then defend it on /q/ with his trip on. He later returned to tripping and allegedly left the moderation position. Allegedly resigned after sometime after being outed.

#### _Useful links_

# Sources:

First of all, there are the primary sources that is 4chan's various pages and news, two of which are the most important:

[http://www.4chan.org/news?all](http://www.4chan.org/news?all) - Of course, the main source.

The #janiteam leaks – The second most important source. It provides background on what the staff thinks of all the evens that happened since early 2012. The insight will change anyone's mind on how the staff works. Hosted on several places.

Onto the secondary sources - Nowadays there are very few active 4chan history sources. Shii's site was taken down due to DMCA, Jkid had to turn off Yotsuba Society due to personal problems, Encyclopedia Dramatica's userbase is too small to properly record 4chan and Internet drama, the archive of the original Wikichan has been lost to history, among many other sites that have disappeared.

Here's a list of the active sources that are not directly related to 4chan:

[https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki) - The Bibliteca Anonoma, or Bibanon is an active wiki project about saving information on internet culture that might otherwise disappear with time, they made a neat summary for the history of 4chan, which I took and revamped. Maintained by shii and other users. It's probably the most up to date wiki about the site.

[https://encyclopediadramatica.es/](https://encyclopediadramatica.es/Main_Page) - Encyclopedia Dramatica - The shithole of the Internet's ever present buttock. While at first glance it seems to be entirely composed of bullshit, ED has loads of information on users and performed raids, including tidbits about the Internet in general, like the first Internet raid ever done and the biggest compilation of creepypasta on the Internet. If there's one thing they excel at, it's at archiving drama. They seem to roam the line between life and death nowadays. Be advised that you must be extremely in tune with ED's culture to be able to device the absurd humour and intentional lies from the truth. Since the GamerGate incident, ED seems to have been taken over by 8channers.

[http://www.lurkmore.com/](http://www.lurkmore.com/wiki/Main_Page) - The LURKMOAR wiki - The first chan culture wiki. It was an effort to compile and explain the crescent amounts of memes and culture 4chan was creating on 2005. Its population slowly shifted to ED, and eventually fell into obscurity and obsoletion. Nowadays it's mainly used as a wiki for its own boards dedicated to camwhores. Still gets updated with 4chan-related information from time to time. To see: GET list

. The site was took down recently due to jKid having to find work, but has recently resurfaced. Important things from this wiki are [http://www.yotsubasociety.org/node/2](http://www.yotsubasociety.org/node/2), which talks about the forerunners of image board culture, and a summary of the history of the Russian chanverse.

Special mentions to:

[http://wikichan.org/](http://wikichan.org/) (Dead link. 2006-2010) – Wikichan – By far the most popular and exhaustive compilation of 4chan information there was. However, as dedicated its userbase was, it was constantly DDoS'd, dropped by ISPs and hacked. It was known not only for compiling info on memes but also for having an extensive list of 4chan user stories and creepypasta. On 2010 the admin decided to call it quits. Many attempts to restore the info on Wikichan where performed, but only partially successful.

1 ISPs that provided Internet as an additional to the phone-line, called Pasokon Tsushin, it cost a monthly fee. The biggest Home Party provider was Nifty-Serve, serving one million users at the time. Anonymous BBS became a viable option because of lax data protection laws in japan, which means nobody will help you if you get hacked. Therefore forums failed to take off because the Japanese were scared of making one.

2 The Japanese had different meanings for the words we have, "hacking" during those days was closer to our definition of cracking games, although they did participate in classic hacking. Trolling was not associated with the action but rather will all things involving raiding a website and BBS continued being the popular term for forums. The Japanese knew visual art as ASCII art, but also knew it as SJIS (Shift\_JIS).

3 Distribution, commercialization and production of child pornography was legal in Japan until 1999. Until then, a considerable part of the Japanese Internet was dedicated to it. Albeit the act was quickly becoming shunned and controversial. Ayashii eventually banned the topic before it was made illegal.

4 Nanashii means nameless and was the default name for all posters, trait that was passed onto 2ch and 2chan.

5 4chan's has always been perceived as a racist site, especially if you came found it after /pol/ was created. This is due to a mix of black comedy and silliness, 4chan developed a "lol, niggers" culture. This didn't get in the way of proper discussion nor was meant as real racism. Although very small amount of users were actually racist, to them it was just comedy.

6 Something Awful's Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse and Fuck You And Die forums respectively

7 The term newfag is a distortion of furfag, an insult used against the overly dramatic furry community.

8 However, there also was a lot of drama regarding tripcode users and mods, who, back then, were allowed to possess a tripcode. Thus the term "modfaggotry".

9 Back during the early days of web 2.0, content aggregators were mostly unheard of, since the internet just came out from the period were it was all small clusters of isolated communities. During those days it was common to see various communities bickering because another one stole their content. EbaumsWorld was the first site to do it en masse and without regard of consequences, embedding code on the frontpage that stole bandwidth from SA and 4chan, which prompted unprecedented retaliation from most of the big players of the era (and a young 4chan tagging along). A Something Awful user even made a flash song about it.

10 Note: Though truth in part, the "low" quality image and content during 2004 to 2006 were welcomed and cherished by the members of the community, therefore becoming quality (Or should I say QUALITY) 4chan content. The reaction against newfags was brought when people did not get the way the memes were done and essentially screwed up.

11 Colourful groups were always around, (evidenced by the early /c/ - Cute/Male (back then being not safe for work), /l/ - Lolicon, /g/ - Guro and /d/ - Hentai/alternative boards), and the random furry forcing his art on everyone. They just began diversifying towards topics other than anime. If I'm not mistaken, Touhou fans were already present, but /a/ users became fed off with them and called moot out to get rid of them, hence the birth of /jp/ - Japanese Culture, in a day known as the /a/-day.

12 There were way far worse things on 4chan already, but the furry fandom was special. During the early days of the internet, the two core websites, SA and a website I can't remember (Fark?), began a crusade against the furry fandom in all its forms. During one memorable moment, Lowtax crated a furry board, waited for it to be filled with furry goons, and permabanned them all. This aggressively eventually shaped internet culture, where it became the norm to hate on furries, and the furry fandom itself, building a constant feeling of paranoia and "fursecution". Moot once created a /fur/ board on April's fool's day 2005, and banned all the users who posted there for a month.

13 An ancient four panel comic about toilet splashing created on /b/ and adopted by /v/. It contained a particular hilarious MS Paint face of total rage, and eventually people got around making panel comics ending with the mentioned rage face. The meme never truly died and continued up to 2011 on /b/ You Laugh You Lose and MS Paint comics thread. However /r/funny and content aggregators took hold and killed it by feat of mass production and simplification (of an already simple comic).

14 An example: 4chan has always had an example of black comedy towards black people, a "lol, niggers" attitude which, on its core, wasn't really racist\*. Many /co/ users completely forget about it and some even lash out against it. \*This doesn't mean there's no racism on 4chan, but almost all of it is properly contained and trolled on /pol/

15 The US Congress's Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate's Protect Intellectual Property act.

16Current hypothesis' say that /pol/'s white supremacists are anti-social idiots that have been rejected by most of the extremely ban-happy white supremacist communities. The majority of /pol/'s population is still composed mainly by trolls and people hoping for a new /b/.

17 Something Awful, who went through a period of extreme Social Justice between 2011 and 2012 (which has now been quelled, the last SJW subforum, laisses faire, being deleted together with all the FYAD-lites), a couple from Reddit's /r/ShitRedditSays (who shared userbase with SA's Laisses Faire and Weird Twitter), Tumblr's Feminists and Social Justice Activists, and various independent people, ranging from white supremacist haters to offended transsexuals. According to some, SA's sad state should also be attributed to a Radical Feminist Lowtax put as second in command.

18 The Jewish Internet Defense Force. It was already notorious before this happened for being the Jewish equivalent of Stormfront.

19 Given its status as a quarantine board, most users believe /pol/ to be completely inhabited by white supremacists. In fact, /pol/ actually tends to discuss politics, but with a tongue-in-cheek or dark humour manner. In many ways this reminds of the /b/ of old, with trolls trolling trolls, catchphrases and memes flying around constantly and people acting silly for the sake of it.

21 Ironically, the JIDF/SRS (Or whoever it was) also contributed to solving the issue: Their constant complaining about /pol/ on /q/ (With their threads being derailed by stormfags all the time) eventually led them to compile their own multiple-posts-long "evidence" vouching for /pol/'s deletion detailing all the links and information regarding the possibility of a Stormfront awareness group, who dedicated themselves to spread their agenda via victimization of the white people, visiting 4chan to spam their ideals there. This wouldn't be really possible, arising from the fact that Stormfront's pseudo-ideology is one of the most closed-minded of all and still believes 4chan is out to get them like years ago, but there's still the fact that whenever you mention race on the site a small band of people will start to drop pseudo studies about why black people is inferior.

22 Originally a small, dead meme called Shibe from Tumblr, which before discovery got 24 reblogs at best. The meme also appeared on Reddit before surfacing from 4chan, but it was also a very small subreddits. While it's creating it not [s4s]'s doing, its popularization definitely was.

23 While it's sound logic, moot didn't realise that said users would still be outraged either way, and the best they could do was explain the situation to the normal users that could string more than 3 coherent sentences together, which would ameliorate the situation a little by reducing the amount of users complaining.

24 This list applies mostly to 4channers that browsed /b/, the least moderated boards and a general rundown of the 4chan userbase. It does not go into board details, which can be radically different.

25 Mainly because by 96', Japanese politics where starting the process that would get rid of CP trading on the nation.

26 It's a mix of different timelines, originally made by some dude on wikichan I believe, other sites added it and wrote down other details. I mixed all timelines into a single one, put it up to date, and added some information I discovered via Google-fu and other sources. Consider this the most complete (But far from exhaustive) timeline currently online.

27 It was in reference to AAAAAIIR, an ancient meme. Pretty much means oldfags raided /b/ by proxy, really. In fact, the whole event led to a short revival of many memes, it could be said that it was a good day for oldfags in general.

28 Staff means: Admins, mods, developers, managers, janitors and any other variants. This is from whatever information I could scrap from many sources. Take all this with pincers and hazmat suit. And don't do the stupid thing and try to contact or witch hunt anyone, they will promptly tell you to fuck off.Mods according to position: +q: Admin/Rizon Operator | +o – Senior | +h – Moderator | +v - Janitor

29 As of March 2014, somewhat accurate thanks to many /j/ leaks. However, remember that janitors come and go very fast. On January 21, 2015, moot mentioned that there are a grand total of 104 4chan staff members.

30 Names in green are unconfirmed.
