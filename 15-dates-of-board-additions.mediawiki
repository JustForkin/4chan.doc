Secret and legendary boards:

/z/ - ¿¿?? – A random board which whose rules where the ZOMG NONE!!!one rule that now resides on /b/'s rules. Users would select their mods via popular vote like the idiot kings of SA's FYAD. The first board mod was Soviet_Russia, known for being a massive tripfag (according to some, he was a mod prior /z/, but that seems unlikely). He ran the board to the ground and was eventually banned. The board was deleted and replaced with the infamous beecock macro &quot;oh noes the board is gone&quot;. At one time, he embedded 56000 images on the board, and the tag /z/ - 56k would remain on the title for months. When the board was deleted, it was replaced with the image of a penis covered in bees with the text &quot;oh noes the board is gone!!1&quot;. That macro would remain on 4chan until April 2014.

/5/ - 5 – Board created for the mod and WTSnacks' friend 5. Only posts about 5 or about five objects where allowed.

/fk/ - For Kidz – Joke board about making a 4chan for kids. Deleted on 2014.

/n/ - TRAINZ – Early test board for trains, later moved to 1chan

/yg/ - Yogurt and something about danimals.

/j/ - Janitors. Later Janitor &amp; Moderator Discussion. Secret HQ where all the world domination plans are schemed.
