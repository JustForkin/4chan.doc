== Staff ==

Staff means: Admins, mods, developers, managers, janitors and any other variants. This is from whatever information I could scrap from many sources. Take all this with pincers and hazmat suit. And don't do stupid shit and try to contact or witch hunt anyone, they will promptly tell you to fuck off.

Mods according to position: 

    +q: Admin/Rizon Operator | +o – Senior | +h – Moderator | +v - Janitor

(Also an incomplete list)

moot (aka Robert Bopkins) - Christopher Poole - Admin, Rizon IRC cop, owner of 4chan LLC, humble and stubborn to the point of being annoying. When the Rizon 4chan IRC was made, his very first words where &quot;I wish to be the little girl&quot;. Somewhat impulsive, which led him to add and remove forced anonymous and IDs from /b/ and other boards on several consecutive times. He dated Maddeth during 2008, was cucked by an undisclosed someone during 2014. Resigned on January 21, 2015. Mourned by all.

KING JAFFE JOFFER - Coder, translated the 4chan Firefox extension to Google Chrome, and refracted the entirety of 4chan's HTML5 code. Resigned circa 2013-2014.

Anonymous-san - asan - Josh (Popularly known as modcat) - #rasberryheaven, goon – Mod since pretty much the beginnings on 4chan, supposedly quitted around April 25, 2012 because he was trying to contact a girl in his circle of friends (Which happens to include moot) or a girl from /soc/, sources vary a lot, and asked for advice on /soc/. He then used the warn function to give his contact info to female posters who were helping, but one flipped her shit out fear of being banned, and another ratted him out with moot who fired him. Some say he asked to have his powers revoked and moot complied. Others say he later asked him to have his mod status back, but moot is the hero 4chan deserves but not the one it needs and denied it. moot later confirmed he resigned during a Q&amp;A on /pol/

Shii – (To this day its unknown whether Menchi is Shii, mods claim they are not) - #raspberryheaven, goon - http://www.shii.org/ - http://aya.shii.org/ and many more – Biggest English Textboard/Imageboard personality before Snacks. Tried to take down 4chan due to loli, but quickly had a change of heart. Member of world2ch (posted as Menchi), later helped moot to code the site on its beginnings by further translating 0ch's PHP (Though not flawlessly) and maintained the textboards. Got banned from Something Awful during the loli purge. He was active from 2003 to 2005, when moot deemed him too dramatic to be a mod. – According to the Aussie modleaks, still a mod as Menchi. Or at least still retaining his privileges but no longer moderating. He is also a Web Archive admin (And deleted some evidence of his involvement in world2ch and 4chan saved in there) and a Wikipedia admin (Where he stored a list of all his loli anime pages). Mod at /dqn/ and /saovq/.

W.T. Snacks - http://cookiethievery.com/ - http://snidnightmacks.tumblr.com/ - Admin. Coder. Internet Meme. Greatest attention-whore to ever grace 4chan. Started during 4chan's revival and made a lot of vital changes to the futallaby code (Reply with an image, quoting, information about posts, being able to see the amount of hidden posts in a thread, also hiding the post from a thread in the first place) Got fired on 2005 due to laziness and moot's lovely bad temper. Used to browse #4chan and advertise his own radio show, Midnight Snacks, which is hosted on 88chan. It's about mini-mixes, remixes and general electronic music. The dude seems to have a knack for it since the Soulseek days. Recently broke his hip skateboarding and now has a nice 60000 bucks debt.

Censored Vagina (AKA C_V) - #rasberryheaven, goon – Admin and a sort of bridge between the community and moot during the early days. Convinced moot to restore /I/ - Lolicon when it got taken down due to CP. Active from 2003 to 2004. He was permabanned from SA due to pedophilia/lolicon.

5 - Had his own secret board dedicated to pictures of him, created by WTSnacks as an in-joke. He was and is Snacks best friend. A few months after Snacks got demodded he stickied a Midnight Snacks thread, which he co-hosted at the time, the thread was unstickied by moot, and then re-stickied. Because of this people believed a mod war was raging and shouted the meme BRING BACK SNACKS. Jokingly, both users called the show &quot;Radio free 4chan&quot; for the night. This and a streak of inactivity cost 5 his mod status. moot later claimed it was a demoddable offense to sticky radio show threads.

Dongfix (AKA Enumeric) - Imgbear.com – Coder, he has written many scripts for the mods and janitors. IRC rat. Resigned on 2013.

Xennon – Flash coder - Admin for one day because of a GET. Supposedly leaked the logs where Snacks was fired by moot.

Soviet_Russia – SoRu – 4chan Mod and famous tripfag, made mod in the legendary board /z/ and attention-whored it to death alongside his brother Dash_Billions. He was eventually banned.

Shut – John - #rasberryheaven goon - Coded around by the time W.T. Snacks was fired (2005) active as far back as 06/2004 and as late as 2007. He maintained the devblog, fixed a bug that allowed huge files on the site if they were .btm.

thatdog - SA/ADTRW goon - http://www.1chan.net/ - Goon that helped coding that PHP around 2003, created the test board /r/ - TRAINZ, funded the site 1chan to satisfy his need for TRAINZ. His website also contains the original overchan, and old, outdated list of *chans. Look there for a piece of the past. Made Futaba-SQL and the beta archive, futallaby around 2003, But got in an argument with moot and dropped support during early 2004 (moot apparently had great skill when it comes to angering people who helps him)

Allyson – underage b&amp; mod from circa 2006. She was kind of a drama whore

Kusanagi (aka KusKus / brbgone2gensokyo) – Kinomod, the famous /a/ mod. He was known for everyone extremely favoring and encouraging of /a/ board culture.

Allegedly resigned after sometime after being outed.
